A luncheon menu, in which a cheese dish is\\nsubstituted for meat, is of interest in this connection, for it shows\\nthe housewife, early in her studies, not only how to combine dishes to\\nproduce a balanced meal, but also how to make up a menu in which meat is\\nnot needed.\\n\\nIn _Eggs_ are discussed the nutritive value of eggs, the ways in which\\nto select, preserve, cook, and serve them, and how to utilize left-over\\neggs. So many uses have eggs in the diet and so nourishing is this food\\nthat too much attention cannot be paid to its preparation. In this\\nlesson, also, is given a breakfast menu to afford practice in preparing\\nseveral simple dishes usually served in this meal.\\n\\nIn _Vegetables_, Parts 1 and 2, every variety of vegetable is discussed\\nas to food value, preparation, place in the meal, and proper methods of\\nserving. With such a fund of knowledge, the housewife will be well\\nequipped to give pleasing variety to her meals.\\n\\nIn addition to the instruction in these matters, there are a large\\nnumber of illustrations, which make clear the important details in every\\nprocess employed and in many recipes show certain steps as well as the\\nfinished result.

As is well understood, milk is the liquid that is secreted by the\\nmammary glands of female mammals for the nourishment of their young. The\\nword milk as it is commonly used, however, refers to _cow's milk,_\\nbecause such milk is employed to a greater extent as human food than the\\nmilk from any other animal. Cow's milk in its perfectly fresh raw state\\nis a yellowish-white, opaque fluid, called _whole milk,_ and, as is well\\nknown, possesses a distinctly sweet taste and characteristic odor. When\\nsuch milk is allowed to stand for some time without being disturbed, it\\nseparates into two distinct layers, an upper and a lower one. The upper\\nlayer, which is lighter than the lower one and occupies a smaller space,\\nconsists largely of globules of fat and is called _cream;_ the lower\\nlayer, which is white or bluish-white in color and is composed of water,\\nsolids, and protein, is, when separated from the cream, called\\n_skim milk._\\n\\n2. As an article of diet, milk is very important, because its sole\\nfunction in nature is to serve as food. It is required by the infant; it\\nis needed in the diet of all growing children; and it is desirable in\\nthe preparation of dishes for both young and old.\\n\\nMilk is used to such a great extent because it fills many of the\\nrequirements of an ideal food. It is generally liked, requires little or\\nno time for preparation, agrees with the majority of persons when used\\nproperly, and contains substances that supply energy and build and\\nrepair tissue. Still, it does not contain these substances in such\\nproportions as to make it an ideal or exclusive article of diet for\\nadults, and it must often be modified to suit the needs of infants,\\nbecause it is ideal for only the young of the species for which it is\\nintended. Therefore, while milk is often called a perfect food, in\\nreality it is perfect for only the calf. When it is desired for the\\nfeeding of a very young child, it must be changed to meet the\\nrequirements before it can be used with good results.\\n\\n3. So important is milk as an article of food that, outside of the\\npurely rural districts, producing the milk supply is a business of\\nconsiderable importance. This is due to the fact that the purity of milk\\nmust be constantly safeguarded in order that clean, safe milk may be\\nprovided for the countless numbers that depend on it. In fact, milk\\nundoubtedly bears a closer relation to public health than any other\\nfood. To produce an adequate amount of clean, safe, pure milk is one of\\nthe food problems of the city and country alike. In the city much of the\\ndifficulty is overcome by the ordinances that provide standards of\\ncomposition and cleanliness, as well as inspection to insure them; but\\nsuch ordinances are rarely provided for in villages and country\\ndistricts.\\n\\nWhen there is no law to prevent it, unclean milk is sometimes used in\\nthe manufacture of butter and cheese, but when this happens, great\\ninjustice, if not positive harm, is done to the consumers of these\\narticles. Then, too, unless milk is carefully inspected, tubercular milk\\nis liable to be used in the making of butter, and such a condition will\\ncause the spreading of tuberculosis as readily as the use of the\\ncontaminated milk itself.\\n\\n4. With its various products, milk helps to form a very large part of\\nthe dietary in most homes, but while nothing can take the place of this\\nfood and while it is high in food value, there seems to be a general\\ntendency to think of it as an addition to the bill of fare, rather than\\nas a possible substitute for more expensive food. For instance, milk is\\nvery often served as a beverage in a meal in which the quantity of meat\\nor other protein foods is not reduced. From an economical standpoint, as\\nwell as from the point of view of the needs of the body, this is really\\nextravagant, for milk is itself largely a protein food. The serving of a\\nglass of milk or of a dish that contains generous quantities of milk\\noffers the housewife an opportunity to cut down considerably the\\nallowance of meat and eggs. Because of this fact and because milk and\\nits products may be used to add nutritive value to a food, to give\\nvariety, and to improve flavor, they deserve considerable study on the\\npart of the housewife.\\n\\n5. Since milk may be used in such a variety of ways, it may be easily\\nincluded in the dietary for the family. Being liquid in form, it may\\nalways be served without any preparation as a beverage or with other\\nbeverages, cereals, and fruits. It also has numerous other uses, being\\nemployed in the making of sauces for vegetables and meats, in the place\\nof stock for soups, and as the liquid for bread, cakes, puddings,\\ncustards, and many frozen desserts. Because of its extensive use, every\\nhousewife not only should know how to buy milk and care for it, but\\nshould be familiar with its composition, so that she may determine\\nwhether or not it suits the needs of her family. In addition, she should\\nknow the effect of heat on milk and the various methods of preparation\\nif she would be able to judge what food combinations can be used\\nwith milk.\\n\\n\\nCOMPOSITION OF MILK\\n\\n6. As milk is usually taken into the body in liquid form, the common\\ntendency is to regard it as a beverage, rather than as an important\\nsource of nourishing food material. However, a knowledge of its\\ncomposition, as well as the fact that milk becomes a solid food in the\\nstomach and must then be dissolved in the process of digestion, will\\nserve to show that milk contains solids. That it possesses all the\\nelements required to sustain life and promote health is proved by the\\nfact that a child may live for months on milk alone and during this time\\nincrease in weight.\\n\\n7. The solids contained in milk are proteins, fat, carbohydrate in the\\nform of sugar, and mineral salts, besides which, of course, water occurs\\nin large quantities. The sugar and fat of milk serve as fuel; the\\nmineral salts are chiefly valuable for the growth of bones and teeth and\\nfor their effect on the liquids of the body; and the proteins, like the\\nfat and sugar, serve as fuel, but they also make and repair the muscular\\ntissues of the body.\\n\\nIn considering the food substances of milk, it will be well to note also\\nthat they vary according to the breed, feeding, and individual\\ncharacteristics of the cow. Jerseys and Guernseys give milk rich in fat\\nand total solids, and while Holstein cows give a greater quantity of\\nmilk, such milk has a smaller proportion of fat and total solids. As a\\nrule, though, the composition of milk may be considered as approximately\\n3.3 per cent. protein, 4 per cent. fat, 5 per cent. carbohydrate, and\\n.7 per cent. mineral matter, making a total of 13 per cent. This\\nindicates the quantity of actual food material in milk, the remainder,\\nor 87 per cent., being water.\\n\\n8. PROTEIN IN MILK.--Because of the double usefulness of protein--to\\nserve as fuel and to make and repair muscular tissue--this element is\\nregarded as an important ingredient of milk. The protein in milk is\\ncalled _casein_. The opaque whiteness of milk is largely due to the\\npresence of this substance. As long as milk remains sweet, the lime\\nsalts it contains hold this casein in solution; but when it sours, the\\nsalts are made soluble and the casein thickens, or coagulates. In\\naddition to casein, milk contains a small amount of protein in the form\\nof _albumin_. This substance, upon being heated, coagulates and causes\\nthe formation of the skin that is always found on the top of milk that\\nhas been heated. The skin thus formed contains everything that is found\\nin milk, because, as it forms, casein is dried with it and sugar and\\nfat, too, are caught and held there. It is the protein of milk and its\\ncharacteristic coagulation that are made use of in the making of cheese.\\nIn cooking, the protein of milk is probably more affected than any of\\nthe other substances, but the degree to which the digestion of milk is\\nthus affected is not definitely known, this being a much\\ndisputed question.\\n\\n9. FAT IN MILK.--The other substance in milk that serves as fuel, or to\\nproduce energy, is fat. It occurs in the form of tiny particles, each\\nsurrounded by a thin covering and suspended in the liquid. Such a\\nmixture, which is called an _emulsion_, is the most easily digested form\\nin which fat is found. The fat in milk varies more than the other food\\nsubstances, it being sometimes as low as 2 per cent, and again as high\\nas 6 per cent. However, the average of these two, or 4 per cent., is the\\nusual amount found in most milk.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the fat globules of milk rise to the top because\\nfat is lighter than water, so that when milk has been undisturbed for\\nsome time the top, which is known as _cream_, will be found to contain\\nmost of the fat. Because of the fat it contains, the cream is yellower\\nin color than the milk underneath. If the cream is beaten, or churned,\\nthese fat particles will adhere in a mass, advantage of this fact being\\ntaken in the making of butter.\\n\\n10. CARBOHYDRATE IN MILK.--The carbohydrate contained in milk is in the\\nform of sugar called _lactose_. It is unlike other sugars in that it is\\nnot very sweet and does not disagree with most persons nor upset their\\ndigestion. For this reason, it is often given to children, invalids, and\\npersons who have digestive disturbances. However, it is like other\\ncarbohydrates in that in solution it ferments. The result of the\\nfermentation in this case is the production of _lactic acid_, which\\nmakes the milk sour. With the fat, lactose makes up the bulk of the\\nenergy-producing material of milk, and while this is important it is\\nonly secondary when compared to the tissue-building power of the protein\\nand minerals. Besides being an important part of milk itself, lactose is\\na valuable by-product in the manufacture of cheese. After being taken\\nfrom _whey_, which is the clear, straw-colored liquid that remains when\\nthe curd, or coagulated portion, is completely removed from the milk,\\nthe lactose is refined and sold in the form of a powder that is used for\\nvarious kinds of infant and invalid feeding.\\n\\n11. MINERAL MATTER IN MILK.--Considerable quantities of mineral salts,\\nwhich are chiefly _lime_, _potash_, and _phosphates_, are found in milk.\\nAs has already been pointed out, these are important in the building of\\nbone and hard tissue in the body, but in addition they help to keep the\\nfluids of the body in the right condition. Because of the work they do,\\nthese mineral salts are necessary in the building of the bodies of\\ngrowing children, and are useful for repair and the regulation of the\\nbody processes in adults. In cheese, butter, and cream, which are the\\nproducts of milk, less of the mineral salts are found in proportion to\\nthe quantity than in whole milk, skim milk, and whey.\\n\\n12. WATER IN MILK.--The percentage of water in milk is much greater than\\nthat of all the other food substances combined, there being more than\\nsix times as much. While this quantity seems very large, it is an\\nadvantage, for milk provides nourishment to persons when they can take\\nneither solid nor more condensed food. On the other hand, the water is a\\ndisadvantage, for it is responsible for the rapid spoiling of milk. This\\nfact is clearly shown in the case of condensed milk, where the water is\\npartly or completely evaporated, for milk of this kind keeps much longer\\nwithout spoiling than either whole or skim milk.\\n\\n\\nPRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM MILK\\n\\n13. Although milk is used extensively in its natural liquid form,\\nconsiderable use is also made of the numerous products of milk, chief\\namong which are cream, skim milk, buttermilk, sour milk, whey, butter,\\nand cheese. In fact, all of these occupy such an important place in the\\ndietary of the majority of homes that it is well for every housewife to\\nunderstand their value. Butter and cheese are discussed in detail later,\\nso that at this time no attention need be given to them. The other\\nproducts, however, are taken up now, with the intention of enabling the\\nhousewife to familiarize herself with their production, nature, and use.\\n\\n14. CREAM.--As has been pointed out, the particles of fat that rise to\\nthe top of milk when it is allowed to remain undisturbed for some time\\nform the product known as cream. Cream may be removed from the milk by\\nskimming it off, or it may be separated from the milk by means of\\nmachinery especially designed for the purpose. The greater the\\nproportion of fat in milk, the thicker, or \\\"heavier,\\\" will be the cream.\\n\\nVarious grades of separated cream are placed on the market, the usual\\nones being those which contain 8, 12, 16, 20, and 40 per cent, of fat.\\nThin cream, which includes the grades that have only a small percentage\\nof fat, contains a larger quantity of milk than the others and is not so\\ndesirable for many purposes. Still, it is used to some extent, because\\nit is cheaper and there are definite uses to which it can be put.\\nMedium-heavy cream is the kind to select when it is desired for\\n_whipping_. This is a process that consists in beating the cream rapidly\\nuntil a mass of tiny bubbles form and become stiff, very much as the\\nwhite of egg does.\\n\\n15. SKIM MILK.--After a part or all of the cream has been removed from\\nwhole milk, that which remains is called skim milk. While practically\\nall of the fat is taken out when milk is skimmed, very little protein or\\nsugar is removed. Therefore, skim milk is still a valuable food, it\\nbeing used to a large extent for cheese making, for the manufacture of\\ncertain commercial foods, and for the feeding of animals. The housewife\\ndoes not, as a rule, buy skim milk; indeed, in some localities the laws\\nprevent its sale because it is considered an adulterated food. However,\\nit is really a wholesome, valuable food that is cheaper than whole milk,\\nand its use in the home should therefore be encouraged from an\\neconomical standpoint. Here it may be used in the preparation of many\\ndishes, such as sauces, cakes, biscuits, muffins, griddle cakes, bread,\\netc., in which butter or other fats are used, and in custards, puddings,\\nices, and numerous other desserts.\\n\\n16. BUTTERMILK.--The milk that remains in butter making after the butter\\nfat has been removed from cream by churning is known by the name\\nbuttermilk. Such milk is similar to skim milk in composition, and unless\\nbutter is made of sweet cream, buttermilk is sour. Buttermilk is used\\nconsiderably as a beverage, but besides this use there are numerous ways\\nin which it may be employed in the preparation of foods, as is pointed\\nout in various recipes. An advantage of buttermilk is that its cost is\\nless than that of whole milk, so that the housewife will do well to make\\nuse of it in the preparation of those foods in which it produces\\nsatisfactory results.\\n\\n17. ARTIFICIAL BUTTERMILK.--Several kinds of sour milk that are called\\nbuttermilk are to be had, particularly at soda fountains and\\nrestaurants. While they are similar to buttermilk they are not the same,\\nbecause they are produced artificially from whole or skimmed sweet milk.\\nThe usual method employed in the making of these artificial buttermilks,\\nas they may well be called, consists in adding to sweet milk tablets\\ncontaining lactic acid or a certain culture of bacteria that induce\\nfermentation, very much as yeast does, and then keeping it at about body\\ntemperature for a number of hours in order to allow the milk to thicken\\nand sour. Such milks exert a beneficial action in the digestive tract,\\nand their food value, provided they are made from whole milk, is just as\\nhigh as that of the original sweet milk. Artificial buttermilks\\ntherefore prove a valuable source of food supply for persons who find\\nthem palatable and who do not care for sweet milk. Their food value may\\nbe increased by adding cream to them.\\n\\n18. SOUR MILK.--Ordinary milk contains large numbers of bacteria that\\nproduce fermentation. When it is allowed to stand for some time, these\\nbacteria act upon the sugar, or lactose, contained in the milk and\\nchange it into lactic acid. This acid gives to the milk a sour taste and\\nat the same time causes the casein of the milk to become a mass known as\\n_curd_, or _clabber_. This mass continues to grow sour and tough until\\nall the milk sugar is converted into lactic acid, so that the longer the\\nmilk stands, the more acid it becomes. Sour milk, however, is useful\\nin the preparation of various dishes, such as hot breads and\\ngriddle cakes.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\\n\\n19. WHEY.--When the curd is completely removed from milk, as in making\\ncheese, a clear, light, yellowish liquid known as whey remains. Whey is\\ncomposed of water, minerals, and milk sugar or lactic acid, and is the\\nleast valuable part of the milk. The ingenious housewife will never be\\nat a loss to make use of this product, for, while its food value is\\nslight, the minerals it contains are important ones. Whey is sometimes\\nused to furnish the liquid for bread making and, in addition, it may be\\nused as a beverage for persons who cannot digest food as heavy as\\nmilk itself.\\n\\n20. COMPARISON OF FOOD VALUES OF MILK PRODUCTS.--So that the housewife\\nmay become familiar with the food values of milk products, there is here\\ngiven, in Fig. 1, a graphic table for the comparison of such products.\\nEach glass is represented as containing approximately 1 pint or 1 pound\\nof the milk product, and the figures underneath each indicate the number\\nof calories found in the quantity represented. The triangle at the side\\nof each indicates the proportion of ash, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and\\nwater, the percentage composition being given at the side. Housewives as\\na rule fully appreciate the food value that is to be found in whole milk\\nand cream, but such products as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are\\nlikely to be ignored.\\n\\n\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF WHOLESOME MILK\\n\\n21. So far as the housewife is concerned, the qualities that\\ncharacterize wholesome milk are without doubt of great interest. She may\\nknow of what use milk is in the diet and the food substances of which it\\nis composed, but unless she understands just what constitutes milk of\\ngood quality, as well as the nature of inferior milk, she cannot very\\nwell provide her family with the kind it should have. Therefore, to\\nassist her in this matter, the characteristics of wholesome milk are\\nhere discussed. Such milk, it will be well to note, must be of the right\\ncomposition, must not be adulterated, must be fresh--that is, not older\\nwhen delivered than is permitted by law--and must be as clean\\nas possible.\\n\\n22. STANDARD OF MILK COMPOSITION.--The housewife usually judges the\\nquality of milk by the amount of cream that rises to the top when milk\\nin a bottle is allowed to remain undisturbed for some time. This is\\nreally an excellent test, because milk that contains only a small amount\\nof cream is of poorer quality than that which contains a larger amount;\\nin other words, the more cream milk contains, the higher will be its\\nfood value and the greater its energy-producing ability. Then, too, milk\\nthat is rich in cream usually contains proportionately large amounts of\\nprotein and sugar.\\n\\nWhile the composition of milk has much to do with the quality of this\\nfood, it varies, as should be noted, in different breeds and even in\\nindividual cows, depending on both the food and the care given to them.\\nFor this reason, milk that is mixed is preferable to the milk of a\\nsingle cow, as the mixing of the milk of a number of cows insures a\\nbetter average composition.\\n\\n23. ADULTERATION OF MILK.--The composition of milk, and hence its\\nquality, is seriously affected by its adulteration. By this is meant the\\nextraction of any of the food substances from whole milk; the addition\\nof anything that tends to weaken or lower its quality or strength; the\\nuse of coloring matter to make it appear of greater value than it\\nactually is; or the use of preservatives to prevent it from souring as\\nsoon as it ordinarily would. It is, of course, illegal to adulterate\\nmilk, yet it is sometimes done. The most convenient and possibly the\\nmost common materials used to adulterate milk are water and skim milk.\\nThe addition of water to milk decreases the quantity of all its food\\nsubstances, but the addition of skim milk reduces the quantity of fat\\nonly. The color of the milk is often affected by the use of these\\nadulterants, but when this happens, yellow coloring is usually added to\\nrestore the original appearance.\\n\\nSometimes the milk that a dairyman markets contains more fat than the\\nlaw requires; but even such milk cannot legally be skimmed nor diluted\\nwith skim milk. The only thing that may be done to it is to mix it with\\nmilk that is low in butter fat and thus obtain a milk that will average\\nthe legal percentage. For instance, if milk from a dairy averages 5 per\\ncent, of butter fat, it may be diluted with milk that contains only 3\\nper cent, of butter fat, because the result of such mixing, which will\\nbe milk averaging 4 per cent, of this food substance, will be the\\nlegal standard.\\n\\n24. To prevent milk from souring, dishonest milk dealers often put into\\nit such preservatives as soda, borax, and formaldehyde. There is no\\ndefinite way of telling whether or not one of these has been used,\\nexcept by a chemical analysis. However, if milk does not sour within a\\nreasonable time when no precautions have been taken to keep it sweet, it\\nshould be looked on with suspicion, for it undoubtedly contains a\\npreservative.\\n\\n25. FRESHNESS OF MILK.--To be most satisfactory for all purposes, milk\\nshould be absolutely fresh. However, it is almost impossible to obtain\\nmilk in this condition, because it is generally sold at a distance from\\nthe source of supply. Milk that is sold in small towns and cities is\\nusually 12 and often 18 to 21 hours old when it is delivered; whereas,\\nin large cities, where the demand is so great that milk must be shipped\\nfrom great distances, it is often 24 to 36 or even 48 hours old when it\\nreaches the consumer. In order that milk may remain sweet long enough to\\npermit it to be delivered at places so far removed from the source of\\nsupply, it must be handled and cared for in the cleanest possible way by\\nthe dealers. Likewise, if the housewife desires to get the best results\\nfrom it, she must follow the same plan, cooling it immediately on\\ndelivery and keeping it cool until it is consumed. The freshness of milk\\ncan be determined only by the length of time it will remain sweet when\\nproper care is given to it.\\n\\n26. CLEANLINESS OF MILK.--Milk may be of the right composition, free\\nfrom all adulteration, and as fresh as it is possible to obtain it, but\\nunless it is clean, it is an injurious food. Milk is rendered unclean or\\nimpure by dirt. In reality, there are two kinds of dirt that may be\\npresent in milk, and it is important to know just what these are and\\nwhat effect they have on milk.\\n\\n27. The less harmful of the two kinds of dirt is the visible dirt that\\ngets into the milk from the cow, the stable, the milker, the milking\\nutensils, and similar sources when these are not scrupulously clean. If\\nmilk containing such dirt is allowed to stand long enough in pans or\\nbottles for the heavier particles to settle, it will be found as\\nsediment in the bottom of the receptacle. To say the least, the presence\\nof such dirt is always disagreeable and frequently produces\\nforeign flavors.\\n\\nStraining the milk through clean absorbent cotton will reveal the\\npresence of such dirt and another kind of dirt that does not show\\nthrough the opaque fluid. This second kind of dirt is generally found in\\nmilk when the first kind is present in any quantity. It is more liable\\nto be harmful than the other, because it enters the milk from the water\\nused in cleaning the receptacles or from some contaminated source.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\\n\\n28. Whenever dirt is present in milk, bacteria are sure to be there; and\\nthe greater the quantity of dirt the greater will be the number of\\nbacteria. Should the housewife desire to compare the cleanliness of\\nseveral lots of milk, she may filter a like quantity from each lot, say\\na quart or a pint, through small disks of absorbent cotton. If, after\\nthe milk has passed through the cotton disk, very little dirt remains on\\nit, as in Fig. 2 (_a_), the milk may be considered as comparatively\\nclean; if the cotton disk appears as in (_b_), the milk may be said to\\nbe only slightly dirty; if it appears as in (_c_), the milk is dirty;\\nand if it appears as in (_d_), the milk is very dirty. Milk that leaves\\na stain like that in (_d_) contains more bacteria than milk that leaves\\na stain like that in (_c_), and so on through all the lots of milk.\\nFiltering milk in this manner, however, does not indicate whether the\\nbacteria are disease producing. Such information can be secured only by\\nmicroscopic examination, and only then by persons who have a knowledge\\nof such matters.\\n\\n29. Since, as has been pointed out, bacteria cling to all dirt, the\\ndirt that milk contains is one of the causes of souring and putrefaction\\nof milk, and may be a cause of disease. Indeed, it is definitely known\\nthat dirty milk sours much more quickly than does clean milk. Actual\\ntests in which clean milk was put in a cool place have proved that it\\nwill keep for weeks, whereas dirty milk will sour in a day or two,\\nespecially in warm weather. This information should point out clearly to\\nthe housewife that it is not merely heat that changes milk or causes it\\nto sour. She should understand in addition, that bacteria grow and\\nmultiply very rapidly when conditions for their growth are provided.\\nThese conditions are moisture, warmth, and the right kind of food, and\\nas all of these are found in milk, this product is really ideal for\\nbacterial development. The only way in which to protect milk is to make\\nsure that no bacteria enter it, or, if they do, to make it impossible\\nfor them to grow. This may be done by keeping the milk so cold that they\\ncannot thrive, or by destroying them in various ways, which are taken\\nup later.\\n\\n30. In former times, there was not much danger of wide-spread disease\\nfrom the milk supply, for it was cared for almost entirely by those who\\nkept a few cows and distributed milk to a small number of customers. In\\nfact, it has been only within the past 50 years that large quantities of\\nmilk are handled by separate dairies and shipped great distances from\\nthe source of supply and that the distribution of milk has become a\\ngreat industry. When so much milk is handled in one place, it is more or\\nless unsafe unless the dairy is kept extremely clean and is conducted in\\nthe most sanitary manner. Experience has shown that too much attention\\ncannot be given to the care of milk, for the lives of great numbers of\\nchildren have been sacrificed through the carelessness of dairymen and\\npersons selling and distributing milk, as well as through the negligence\\nof those who handle the milk after it has entered the home. To overcome\\nmuch of this carelessness, both the Federal Government and the various\\nstates of this country have set standards for safe milk production, and\\nin order to make their laws effective have established inspection\\nservice. Independently of these state and national laws, many of the\\ncities, particularly the large ones, have made their own standards,\\nwhich, as a rule, are very rigid. One of the usual requirements is to\\ncompel each person who wishes to sell milk in the city to buy a license,\\nso that the city authorities may keep in touch with those handling milk\\nand so that conditions may be investigated at any time. In view of the\\ncare required of dealers in handling milk, the housewife owes it to\\nherself and the members of her family to keep the milk in the home in\\nthe best possible manner.\\n\\n\\nGRADES OF CLEAN MILK\\n\\n31. Ever since milk has come to be a commercial product, authorities\\nhave been devising ways in which it may be brought to the consumer in a\\ncondition that will permit it to be used without causing ill results.\\nTheir efforts have been rewarded to such an extent that nowadays\\nconsumers have little to fear from the milk they purchase, provided they\\nget it from dealers who live up to the laws. Chief among the different\\ngrades of clean milk is _certified milk,_ and next in order comes\\n_pasteurized milk,_ followed by _sterilized milk_.\\n\\n32. CERTIFIED MILK.--The grade of clean milk sold under the name of\\ncertified milk is simply natural, raw milk that is produced and marketed\\nunder conditions that permit it to be guaranteed as pure, wholesome, and\\nof definite composition. Such milk is necessarily higher in price than\\nmilk that is less wholesome and sanitary, because of the extra cost to\\nthe dairyman in meeting the requirements that make it possible for him\\nto produce clean milk under sanitary conditions. These requirements\\npertain to the health and cleanliness of those who handle the milk, to\\nthe health, housing condition, and care of the herd and the dairy cows,\\nand to the handling and care of milk in the dairy and during\\ntransportation and delivery. They are usually established and enforced\\nby an inspection commission appointed by the city, county, or state in\\nwhich the milk is produced.\\n\\n33. If a little careful thought is given to the milk situation, it will\\nbe admitted that such precautions are necessary if clean milk is to be\\nthe result. Such milk cannot be produced if the surroundings are dirty,\\nbecause dust and flies, which are two sources of contamination, are\\npractically always present in such places. A stable with poor\\nventilation, without screens to keep out flies, and with floors that\\nwill not permit of cleaning, but cause filth and refuse to accumulate,\\nis sure to contaminate milk that is handled in it. In addition, cows\\nthat are not well fed, comfortably housed, or carefully groomed cannot\\nbe expected to give milk of as good quality as cows that are properly\\ncared for. Likewise, if the persons who do the milking are not clean,\\nthe milk is subject to contamination from this source.\\n\\n34. All such unfavorable conditions can be remedied, and must be in the\\nproduction of certified milk; but the good accomplished in this\\ndirection will be lost if the milk is carelessly handled after milking.\\nTherefore, in producing certified milk, only the cleanest water\\navailable is allowed to be used in the dairy. Impure water is a common\\nsource of the contamination of milk in such places. On some farms, the\\nwater supply comes from a well that is too near the barn or that is too\\nshallow to avoid being made impure by the germs that filter into it from\\nthe barnyard or a cesspool. If vessels in which milk is placed are\\nwashed in such water, it is necessary to sterilize them by boiling or\\nsteaming before milk is put into them, in order to kill the germs that\\ncome from the water. If such a precaution as this is not observed, the\\ngerms will multiply rapidly in the milk and, provided they are\\ndisease-producing, will make the milk extremely dangerous.\\n\\nBesides observing the precautions mentioned, it is necessary that all\\nutensils used in a dairy, such as pails for milking, strainers,\\ncontainers, etc., be kept scrupulously clean. Likewise, they must be\\nsterilized by boiling each time they are used, for, while disease germs\\nmay be absent, those which cause the milk to sour are always present and\\nmust be destroyed. Finally, to prevent any germs that enter milk from\\nmultiplying, even when it is properly cared for, the milk has to be\\ncooled to a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or lower immediately\\nafter milking and then bottled in sterilized bottles, sealed, and packed\\nin ice, within 20 minutes after milking.\\n\\n35. It is by giving attention to all such matters that certified milk is\\npossible. Such milk, as will be understood from what has been said, is\\nneither a cooked milk nor a dirty milk that is processed, but a natural,\\nraw milk that is clean at all stages of its production and marketing.\\nBecause of this fact, it is the best and cleanest milk to be had and may\\nbe used without hesitation, not only by grown persons in good health,\\nbut for infants and invalids.\\n\\nThe sanitary condition of certified milk and the consequent length of\\ntime it will remain sweet was demonstrated conclusively as far back as\\n1900 at the Paris Exposition. At this time, two model dairies in the\\nUnited States--one located at the University of Illinois and the other\\nat Briarcliff Manor, Westchester County, New York--delivered to their\\nbooths at the Exposition milk that was bottled under the most sanitary\\nconditions at their dairies. During its transit across the ocean the\\nmilk was kept at a temperature of 40 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and on\\nits arrival, 2 weeks after leaving the dairies, it was found to be in a\\nperfectly sweet condition. Similar experiments made at later dates, such\\nas shipping certified milk from the East to California, serve to bear\\nout the test made in 1900, and prove what can be done with milk so\\nproduced as to be as free as possible from bacteria or the conditions\\nthat permit their growth.\\n\\n36. PASTEURIZED MILK.--While certified milk is undoubtedly the safest\\nkind of milk to use and is constantly growing in favor, much of the milk\\nreceived in the home is pasteurized. By pasteurized milk is meant milk\\nthat has been heated to a temperature of 140 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nkept at this temperature for 15 to 20 minutes, and then cooled rapidly.\\nThe result of such a treatment is that any disease-producing germs that\\nare present in the milk, as well as those which are likely to cause\\nintestinal disturbances, are destroyed, and that the milk is rendered\\nsafe as food for a time. Pasteurizing does not materially change the\\ntaste of milk, nor does it seriously affect the digestive properties of\\nthis food. It is true, of course, that pasteurized milk is not so good\\nas clean raw milk. Still it is better to use such milk than to run the\\nrisk of using milk that might be contaminated with the germs of\\ntuberculosis, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or any other of\\nthe numerous diseases that have been known to be carried to whole\\nfamilies and communities through the milk supply.\\n\\n37. Although pasteurizing is done on a large scale in dairies, there is\\nno reason why the housewife cannot pasteurize the milk she buys,\\nprovided it is raw milk and she feels that it is not safe to use. If\\npasteurizing is to be done frequently and large quantities of milk are\\nto be treated, it would be advisable to purchase the convenient\\napparatus that is to be had. However, if only a small quantity of milk\\nis to be pasteurized at a time, a simple improvised outfit will prove\\nsatisfactory, because milk pasteurized in the home may be heated in the\\nbottles in which it is received. Such an outfit consists of a dairy\\nthermometer, a deep vessel, and a perforated pie tin or a wire rack of\\nsuitable size.\\n\\n38. To pasteurize milk in the home, proceed in the manner illustrated\\nin Fig. 3. Place the rack or invert the perforated pie tin in the bottom\\nof the vessel, and on it place the bottles of milk from which the caps\\nhave not been removed. Make a hole through the cap of one bottle, and\\ninsert the thermometer into the milk through this hole. Then fill the\\nvessel with cold water to within an inch or so of the top of the\\nbottles, taking care not to put in so much water as to make the bottles\\nfloat. Place the vessel over the fire, heat it until the thermometer in\\nthe bottle registers a few degrees over 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and keep\\nthe milk at this temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. At the end of this\\ntime, the milk will be sufficiently pasteurized and may be removed from\\nthe fire. As soon as it is taken from the water, cool it as rapidly as\\npossible by running cold water into the vessel slowly or by placing the\\nbottles in several changes of water, taking care not to place the hot\\nbottles in very cold water at first, as this may cause them to crack.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\\n\\nWhen the milk has been cooled by some rapid method, keep it cool until\\nit is used. This precaution is necessary because of the nature of\\npasteurized milk. The temperature at which milk is pasteurized is\\nsufficient to kill all fully developed bacteria, but those which exist\\nin an undeveloped state, or in the form of spores, develop very rapidly\\nafter pasteurization unless the milk is kept cold and clean. If these\\nbacteria were allowed to develop, the purpose of pasteurization would be\\nlost, and the milk would become as dangerous as it was originally. The\\nadvantage of cooling milk rapidly will be fully appreciated upon\\nreferring to Fig. 4, which illustrates the development of a single germ\\nin milk that is cooled rapidly and in milk that is cooled slowly.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\\n\\n39. STERILIZED MILK.--By sterilized milk is meant milk in which all\\ngerms are destroyed by sterilization. Such milk is not sold by dealers,\\nbut the process of sterilization is resorted to in the home when\\npasteurization is not sufficient to render milk safe. This process,\\nwhich is the only positive means of destroying all germs, consists in\\nbringing the milk to the boiling point, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nallowing it to boil for three quarters of an hour, and then cooling it\\nrapidly. One who undertakes to treat milk in this way should remember\\nthat it is difficult to boil milk, because the solids in the milk adhere\\nto the bottom and sides of the vessel and soon burn. However, this\\ndifficulty can be overcome by sterilizing the milk in the bottles in\\nwhich it is bought.\\n\\n40. To sterilize milk, place the sealed bottles on a wire rack or a\\nperforated pie tin in a deep vessel, as for the pasteurizing of milk,\\nand pour cold water into the vessel until it nearly covers the bottles.\\nThen raise the temperature of the water quickly to the boiling point,\\nand after it has begun to bubble, allow it to boil for three quarters of\\nan hour. At the end of this time, cool the milk rapidly and then keep it\\ncool until it is used.\\n\\n41. Although milk thus treated becomes safe, sterilization changes its\\nflavor and digestibility. If milk of this kind must be used, some raw\\nfood should be given with it. A diet composed entirely of cooked food is\\nnot so ideal as one in which some raw food is included, because raw\\nfoods contain substances that are essential to health. The change that\\ntakes place in the composition of milk that has been sterilized can be\\neasily observed. Such milk on becoming sour does not coagulate as does\\npasteurized or raw milk, owing to the fact that the lime salts in the\\nmilk are so changed by the high temperature as to prevent the thickening\\nprocess from taking place. Then, too, sterilized milk is not likely to\\nbecome sour even after considerable time. Still, such milk is not safe\\nto use except when it is fresh, for instead of fermenting in the usual\\nway it putrefies and is liable to cause such a dangerous sickness as\\nptomaine poisoning.\\n\\n42. MODIFIED MILK.--For infants who cannot be fed their normal diet,\\ncow's milk must be used as a substitute, but in order to make it a more\\nnearly ideal food for them it must usually be modified, or changed, by\\nadding other materials. When it is so treated, it is known as modified\\nmilk. The materials used to modify milk are sterile water, lime water,\\nbarley water, cream, skim milk, milk sugar, or some other easily\\ndigested carbohydrate, one of these or a combination of them always\\nbeing employed. The proportion of these ingredients to use varies with\\nthe age of the child that is to be fed and must be constantly changed to\\nmeet the child's requirements. In the production of modified milk, a\\nphysician's prescription and directions should always be followed\\nclosely. Only the best quality of milk should be used, and, in addition,\\nthe greatest care should be taken to have all the bottles, utensils, and\\nmaterials used as clean and sterile as it is possible to make them. If\\nsuch conditions cannot be met, it is advisable to pasteurize the\\nmodified-milk mixture after the materials have been put together.\\n\\n\\nPRESERVED MILK\\n\\n43. Besides milk that is commonly sold by dairymen and milk dealers, it\\nis possible to buy in the market many grades of so-called PRESERVED\\nMILK. Such milk is produced by driving off all or part of the water\\ncontained in milk, and it is sold as _condensed, evaporated,_ and\\n_powdered milk_. Usually, it is put up in tin cans, and while it is not\\nused so extensively as regular milk, many firms are engaged in its\\npreparation.\\n\\n44. CONDENSED AND EVAPORATED MILK.--As has just been mentioned,\\ncondensed and evaporated milk is produced by the complete or partial\\nevaporation of the water contained in milk. Such milk can be shipped\\nlong distances or kept for long periods of time, because it does not\\ncontain sufficient moisture to permit the growth of bacteria. In\\nevaporating milk to produce these preserved milks, each gallon is\\ndiminished in quantity to about two and one quarter pints, the original\\n87 per cent. of water being reduced to about 25 per cent. Therefore, in\\norder to use such milk, sufficient water must be added to restore it to\\nits original composition. Sometimes comparatively large amounts of cane\\nsugar are added to such milks, which, besides sweetening them, assist in\\ntheir preservation. If cane sugar is not used, the milks are usually\\nmade sterile in order to prevent them from spoiling.\\n\\n45. POWDERED MILK.--The form of preserved milk known as powdered milk\\nis the result of completely evaporating the water in milk. Such milk has\\nthe appearance of a dry powdered substance. It does not spoil easily and\\nis so greatly reduced in quantity that it can be conveniently stored.\\nBecause of these characteristics, this product, for which skim milk is\\ngenerally used, is extensively manufactured. It is used chiefly by\\nbakers and confectioners, and, as in the case of evaporated or condensed\\nmilk, the water that has been evaporated in the powdering process must\\nbe supplied when the milk is used.\\n\\n\\nSTANDARD GRADING OF MILK AND CREAM\\n\\n46. In order that a definite idea may be formed of the sanitary and\\nbacteriological standards that are set by milk commissions, there are\\nhere given, in Table I, the regulations governing the grades and\\ndesignation of milk and cream that may be sold in the city of New York.\\nAs will be observed from a study of this table, only definite grades of\\nmilk and cream can be sold in that city; likewise, it must conform to\\ncertain standards of purity and the producer must handle it in such a\\nway that it may be delivered to the consumer in as clean and fresh a\\ncondition as possible.\\n\\nWithout doubt, a grading similar to this one will become general\\nthroughout the United States eventually, for this is the only way by\\nwhich the housewife may know with certainty whether or not the milk she\\npurchases is of the right composition and is safe, fresh, and sanitary\\nin every respect. The different qualities of milk and cream as shown by\\nthis grading are, of course, sold at different prices, those which\\nrequire the greatest care and expense in handling selling for the\\nhighest price.\\n\\n\\nMILK IN THE HOME\\n\\nPURCHASE OF MILK\\n\\n47. After the housewife has become familiar with the points that she\\nshould know concerning milk, she will be much better equipped to\\npurchase milk of the right kind for her home. However, there are still\\nsome points for her to observe when she is purchasing milk if she would\\nsupply her family with the best quality of this food.\\n\\n48. In the first place, she should buy milk from a reliable dealer who\\nwill not object to questioning, and, if possible, she should make an\\ninvestigation of the dairy that supplies the milk that she uses. If she\\ncannot investigate the dairy personally, she should at least endeavor to\\nobtain information from those who are prepared to give it. If she learns\\nthat the conditions in the dairy that is supplying her with milk are not\\nwhat they should be, she should try to obtain milk from some other\\nsource. Of course, she should remember that milk of the best and\\ncleanest quality is the highest in price, because of the increased cost\\nof production; but it is usually advisable to pay the higher price,\\nespecially if children are to be fed, because cheap milk is liable to be\\nunsafe, at least for any purpose that will require it to be served\\nwithout cooking. Should the income not allow the best quality of milk to\\nbe used for all purposes, a cheaper grade can be used for cooking, but\\nit is always economical to purchase the best quality when this food is\\nto be used as a beverage.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\\n\\n49. In the next place, the housewife should purchase milk from a dealer\\nwho delivers cold milk, because, as has been mentioned, bacteria\\nmultiply rapidly in warm milk. She should also try to obtain milk put up\\nin bottles, for such milk has advantages over milk dipped from a can in\\nthat it does not have the same chance to become dirty and it affords a\\ngreater opportunity to secure accurate measurement. The kind of caps\\nused on milk bottles should also be observed. Caps that have to be pried\\nout with a knife or a similar utensil are not nearly so satisfactory as\\nthose shown in Fig. 5 (_a_), which have small tabs _a_ that permit the\\ncap to be lifted out. In addition to the caps, which serve to keep dirt\\nout of the milk and permit it to be delivered without being spilled,\\nsome dealers use covers like that shown in (_b_). Such covers are held\\nin place by a wire and serve further to protect the milk from\\ncontamination.\\n\\nIf milk purchased in bottles is clean, there should be no sediment in\\nthe bottom of the bottle after it has been allowed to stand for some\\ntime. Also, if it is fresh, it will not sour quickly after it is\\ndelivered, so that in case it is properly cared for and sours quickly,\\nit may be known to be stale milk. However, if it does not sour in the\\nnormal length of time, it should be looked on with suspicion, for, as\\nhas been pointed out, such milk may have added to it a preservative to\\nprevent souring. The housewife may expect milk that is delivered cold\\nand is guaranteed to be sanitary and fresh to remain sweet at least 24\\nhours, provided, of course, it is placed in the refrigerator immediately\\nupon delivery and kept there until used.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nREGULATIONS GOVERNING THE GRADES AND DESIGNATION OF MILK AND CREAM WHICH\\nMAY BE SOLD IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK\\n\\nThe following classifications apply to milk and cream.

NECESSITY FOR CARE IN THE HOME.--If milk of good quality is bought,\\nand, as has been suggested, this should be done whenever it is possible,\\nthe next thing to do is to care for it in such a way that it may be fed\\nto the family in the same condition as it was when delivered. It is, of\\ncourse, of prime importance that the dairyman deliver clean fresh milk,\\nbut this is not sufficient; the milk must remain in this condition until\\nit is used, and this can occur only when the housewife knows how to care\\nfor it properly after it enters the home. It is possible to make safe\\nmilk unsafe and unsafe milk positively dangerous unless the housewife\\nunderstands how to care for milk and puts into practice what she knows\\nconcerning this matter. Indeed, some of the blame laid to the careless\\nhandling of milk by dairymen really belongs to housewives, for very\\noften they do not take care of milk in the right way after delivery. As\\ntoo much attention cannot be given to this matter, explicit directions\\nare here outlined, with the idea of assisting the housewife in this\\nmatter as much as possible.\\n\\n51. KEEPING MILK CLEAN IN THE HOME.--Immediately upon delivery, the\\nbottle containing the milk should be placed in the coolest place\\navailable, never being allowed to stand on the porch in the sun or where\\nsuch animals as cats or dogs may come in contact with it. When the milk\\nis to be used, the paper cap should be carefully wiped before it is\\nremoved from the bottle, so that any dirt that may be on top will not\\nfall into the milk. If not all the milk is used and the bottle must be\\nreturned to the cool place where it is kept, it should be covered by\\nmeans of an inverted drinking glass or, as shown in Fig. 6, by a glass\\nor porcelain cover. Such covers, or _sanitary milk_ _caps_, as they are\\ncalled, are very convenient for this purpose and may be purchased at a\\nslight cost.\\n\\n52. Another precaution that should be taken is never to mix stale milk\\nwith fresh milk, because the entire quantity will become sour in the\\nsame length of time as the stale milk would. Also, milk that has been\\npoured into a pitcher or any other open vessel and allowed to stand\\nexposed to the air for some time should never be put back into the\\nbottle with the remaining milk. Such milk is sure to be contaminated\\nwith the germs that are always present in the dust constantly\\ncirculating in the air. It is sometimes necessary to keep milk in a\\nvessel other than the bottle in which it is delivered. In such an event,\\nthe vessel that is used should be washed thoroughly, boiled in clean\\nwater, and cooled before the milk is poured into it.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\\n\\n53. Particular care should be taken of the empty milk bottles. They\\nshould never be used for anything except milk. Before they are returned\\nto the dairyman to be used again, they should first be rinsed with cold\\nwater, then washed thoroughly with hot, soapy water, and finally rinsed\\nwith hot water. If there is illness in the home, the washed bottles\\nshould be put into a pan of cool water, allowed to come to a boil, and\\npermitted to boil for a few minutes. Such attention will free the\\nbottles from any contamination they might have received. The dairyman,\\nof course, gives the bottles further attention before he uses them\\nagain, but the housewife should do her part by making sure that they are\\nthoroughly cleansed before they are collected by him.\\n\\n54. KEEPING MILK COOL IN THE HOME.--As has been pointed out, milk\\nshould, upon being received, be kept in the coolest place available,\\nwhich, in the majority of homes at the present time, is the\\nrefrigerator. In making use of the refrigerator for this purpose, the\\nhousewife should put into practice what she learned in _Essentials of\\nCookery_, Part 2, concerning the proper placing of food in the\\nrefrigerator, remembering that milk should be placed where it will\\nremain the coolest and where it is least likely to absorb odors. She\\nshould also bear in mind that the temperature inside of a refrigerator\\nvaries with that of the surrounding air. It is because of this fact that\\nmilk often sours when the temperature is high, as in summer, for\\ninstance, even though it is kept in the refrigerator.\\n\\n55. In case a refrigerator is not available, it will be necessary to\\nresort to other means of keeping milk cool. A cool cellar or basement is\\nan excellent substitute, but if milk is kept in either of these places,\\nit must be tightly covered. Then, too, the spring house with its stream\\nof running water is fully as good as a refrigerator And is used\\nextensively in farming districts. But even though a housewife has none\\nof these at her disposal, she need not be deprived of fresh milk, for\\nthere are still other ways of keeping milk cool and consequently fresh.\\nA very simple way in which to keep milk cool is to weight down the\\nbottles in a vessel that is deeper than they are and then pour cold\\nwater into the vessel until it reaches the top of the bottles, replacing\\nthe water occasionally as it becomes warm. A still better way, however,\\nso far as convenience and results are concerned, is that illustrated in\\nFig. 7. As shown, wrap the bottle in a clean towel or piece of cotton\\ncloth so that one corner of it is left loose at the top. Then place this\\nend in a pan of cold water that stands higher than the bottle. Such an\\narrangement will keep the cloth wet constantly and by the evaporation of\\nthe water from it will cause the milk to remain cool.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\\n\\n\\nCOOKING MILK\\n\\n56. POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING MILK.--Because of the nature of\\nmilk and its constituents, the cooking of this liquid is a little more\\ndifficult than would appear at first thought. In fact, heating milk to a\\ntemperature greater than 155 degrees Fahrenheit causes several changes\\nto occur in it, one of which, the coagulation of the albumin, has\\nalready been mentioned. As the albumin hardens into the layer that\\nforms on the top of boiled milk, a certain amount of fat, sugar, and\\ncasein becomes entangled in it, and if the coagulated skin is rejected,\\nthese food substances, in addition to the albumin, are lost. Another\\nchange that results from boiling is in the fat globules that remain, for\\nthese separate and exist no longer in the form of cream.\\n\\n57. When milk that is not perfectly fresh is cooked with other materials\\nor soups, sauces, and puddings it sometimes curdles. To prevent\\ncurdling, the milk should be heated as rapidly as possible before it is\\nused with the other ingredients. While the separate heating of the milk\\ninvolves a little more work, time may be gained by heating the milk\\nwhile the remaining ingredients are being prepared. The curdling of\\ncomparatively fresh milk is often caused by the addition of salt,\\nespecially if the salt is added when the milk is hot. However, if a\\npinch of bicarbonate of soda is added to the milk before it is heated,\\nit will not be likely to curdle even though it is not absolutely fresh.\\nWhen tomato is to be used in soup that contains milk or cream, curdling\\ncan be prevented if the milk or the cream to be used is thickened with\\nflour or corn starch or a little soda is added to the tomato before the\\ntwo are mixed. The mixing is accomplished by pouring the _tomato into\\nthe milk_ instead of the milk into the tomato. When acid fruit juices\\nare to be added to milk or cream and the mixture then frozen, curdling\\ncan be prevented by thoroughly chilling the milk or cream in the freezer\\ncan before combining it with the juices.\\n\\n58. As has already been learned, great care must be taken in the heating\\nof milk, because the solids that it contains adhere quickly to the\\nbottom of the pan and cause the milk to scorch. For this reason, milk\\nshould never be heated directly over the flame unless the intention is\\nto boil it, and even if it must be boiled every precaution should be\\ntaken to prevent it from burning. It should be remembered, too, that a\\nvery small scorched area will be sufficient to make a quantity of milk\\ntaste burned. The utensil in which milk can be heated in the most\\nsatisfactory way is the double boiler, for the milk does not come in\\ndirect contact with the heat in this utensil. If a double boiler is not\\navailable, good results can be obtained by setting one pan into another\\nthat contains water.\\n\\n59. Milk is often used in place of water for cooking cereals, beverages,\\npuddings, soups, etc. This is good practice and should be followed\\nwhenever possible, for when milk is added it serves to increase the\\nnutritive value of the food. It should be observed, however, that more\\ntime is required to cook grains or cereals in milk than to cook them in\\nwater, because milk contains more solid matter than water and is not\\nabsorbed so quickly. Another frequent use of milk is in breads and\\nbiscuits, where, as is explained in _Bread_ and _Hot Breads_, it\\nproduces a browner and more tender crust than water.\\n\\n60. VARIETY OF WAYS TO USE MILK IN COOKING.--Because of the numerous\\npurposes for which milk is required in the preparation of foods, the\\nsmallest amount of it, whether sweet or sour, can be utilized in\\ncooking; therefore, no milk need ever be wasted. A few of the uses to\\nwhich this food is oftenest put are mentioned briefly in order that the\\nhousewife may be familiar enough with them to call them to mind whenever\\nshe desires to carry out a recipe that calls for milk or when she has\\noccasion to utilize milk that she has on hand.\\n\\nMilk thickened slightly with flour and flavored with such material as\\ncorn, asparagus, celery, tomatoes, beans, peas, or fish makes a\\ndelicious soup. In bisques, or thickened soups, and in chowders, the\\nliquid used need not be milk, but these are made very appetizing if milk\\nis used for part or all of the liquid. Then, too, sauces or gravies made\\nwith milk, thickened with flour, and made rich with butter or other fat\\nlend themselves to a variety of uses. Dice of vegetables, meat, fish, or\\ngame added to a sauce of this kind and served in pastry cases or over\\ntoast provide dishes that are delightful additions to any meal. Milk is\\nalso used as the basis for custards, blanc manges, ices, sherbets, ice\\ncreams, and tapioca, rice, and bread puddings in which eggs, starchy\\nmaterials, and flavorings are added and the mixture then baked, steamed,\\nboiled, or frozen, as the desired result may require. As is well known,\\nmilk is practically indispensable in the making of cakes, cookies, quick\\nbreads, and in fact nearly all dough mixtures. Even if it has soured, it\\ncan be used with soda to take the place of cream of tartar in mixtures\\nthat are to be made light, the lactic acid in the sour milk acting with\\nthe soda as leavening. Left-over milk in comparatively large quantities\\nmay also be used in the home for the making of cheese, although this\\nproduct of milk is usually produced commercially.\\n\\n\\nRECIPES FOR MILK DISHES AND SAUCES\\n\\nFOODS CONTAINING MILK\\n\\n61. From the discussion given up to this point, it will be noted that\\nmilk is used in a large variety of ways and in the making of numerous\\ndishes. However, most of the dishes in which this liquid occurs involve\\nother important materials, so that the recipes for them are usually\\nlisted under some other ingredient or division of cookery. For instance,\\nmilk is used in the making of ice cream, but as the ice creams are\\nincluded among cold desserts, recipes for them would naturally come in\\nthe Section pertaining to this subject. Milk is also an important\\ningredient in puddings, but the recipes for such dishes are given in the\\nSection in which puddings and their sauces are discussed.\\n\\nBecause of this fact, there are only a few recipes that have milk as\\ntheir basis, and this accounts for the small number of recipes here\\ngiven. Chief among the recipes that involve principally milk are those\\nfor junket and white sauce, and while the number of these is small and\\nthe use of the dishes not so general as some kinds of food, just as much\\nattention should be given to them as if they occurred in greater numbers\\nand were used more commonly. Junket is very easily made and should\\ntherefore cause the housewife no concern; likewise, little difficulty\\nwill be experienced if the directions here given for white sauces are\\nfollowed explicitly.\\n\\n\\nRECIPES FOR JUNKET\\n\\n62. Plain Junket.--In the stomachs of all animals that use milk as food\\nis found a digestive ferment known as _rennin_. This is taken from the\\nstomachs of calves, made up commercially, and sold in the form of\\ntablets called _junket_. When these tablets are used properly with milk,\\nthey coagulate the milk and make an excellent dessert that resembles\\ncustard and that is very easy to digest. Because of its nature and\\nqualities, this kind of dessert is used largely for invalids and\\nchildren. The following recipe gives the proportion and directions for\\nmaking this dessert in its simplest form.\\n\\nPLAIN JUNKET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1 junket tablet\\n1 Tb. cold water\\n1 qt. milk\\n4 Tb. sugar\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1/2 tsp. vanilla or other flavoring\\n\\nDissolve the junket tablet in the cold water. Warm the milk very slowly\\nto 100 degrees Fahrenheit, testing the temperature to make sure that it\\nis right. If a thermometer is not on hand, this can be done by dropping\\na drop on the back of the hand. When neither heat nor cold can be felt\\nfrom this drop of milk, it may be known to be very near the body\\ntemperature, the temperature at which rennin is active. If temperature\\nis found to be too high, the milk must be cooled before the tablet is\\nadded. When the desired temperature has been reached, add the sugar, the\\nalt, the junket dissolved in the water, and the flavoring. Then pour all\\ninto individual molds and keep it where it will remain warm for about 10\\nminutes, at the end of which it should be firm like a custard and may be\\ncooled. Keep the junket cool until it is to be served, when it may be\\nturned out of the mold or served in it. As junket will turn to whey if\\nit is broken with a spoon to any extent, serving it in the mold is the\\nbetter plan.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8]\\n\\n63. Junket With. Fruit.--The addition of fruit to junket, as in the dish\\nillustrated in Fig. 8, makes an attractive dessert for both sick and\\nwell people. If the fruit used is permissible in the diet of an invalid,\\nits combination with junket adds variety to the diet. In the making of\\nthis dessert, all juice should be carefully drained from the fruit\\nbefore the junket is poured over it. Canned or fresh fruits may be used\\nwith equally good results.\\n\\nJUNKET WITH FRUIT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1 junket tablet\\n1 Tb. cold water\\n1 qt. milk\\n1/4 c. sugar\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\nFlavoring\\n8 halves of canned peaches or\\n1 c. of berries or small fruit\\n\\nMake a junket as directed in the preceding recipe. Drain all juice from\\nthe fruit and place a half peach or a spoonful of fruit in the bottom of\\neach of the eight molds and pour the junket over it to fill the mold.\\nLet it solidify and serve cold.\\n\\n64. CHOCOLATE JUNKET.--Chocolate added to plain junket not only varies\\nthe junket dessert, but also adds food value, since chocolate contains a\\nlarge quantity of fat that is easily digested by most persons. Where the\\nflavor of chocolate is found agreeable, such junket may be served in\\nplace of the plain junket.\\n\\nCHOCOLATE JUNKET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c. milk\\n2 sq. chocolate\\n6 Tb. sugar\\n3/4 c. water\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1/2 tsp. vanilla\\n1 junket tablet\\n\\nHeat the milk to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, testing in the manner explained\\nin Art. 62. Melt the chocolate in a saucepan, add to it the sugar and 1\\ncupful of water, and cook until smooth; then cool and add to the warm\\nmilk, putting in the salt, vanilla, and junket tablet dissolved in\\ncupful of the water. Turn the junket into a dish or into molds and let\\nstand in a warm place until set; then chill and serve. In preparing this\\nrecipe, it will be well to note that if sweet chocolate is used less\\nsugar than is specified may be employed.\\n\\n65. CARAMEL JUNKET.--In the making of caramel junket, browned, or\\ncaramelized, sugar and water take the place of part of the milk, and\\nwhile a certain amount of the sugar is reduced in the browning, the\\ncaramel is still very high in food value and adds nutritive material to\\nthe dessert. There is nothing about caramel junket to prevent its being\\ngiven to any one able to take plain junket, and if it is made correctly\\nit has a very delightful flavor.\\n\\nCARAMEL JUNKET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c.     milk\\n1/2 c.   sugar\\n1/2 c.   boiling water\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1 tsp.   vanilla\\n1        junket tablet\\n         Whipped cream\\n1/4 c.   chopped nuts\\n\\nHeat the milk to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Caramelize the sugar by melting\\nit in a saucepan directly over the flame until it is a light-brown\\ncolor; then stir in the boiling water and cook until the caramel and the\\nwater become a sirup, after which cool and add to the milk Add the\\nsalt, the vanilla, and the junket tablet dissolved in a tablespoonful of\\ncold water Pour the mixture into a dish, let it stand in a warm place\\nuntil it sets; then chill, cover with sweetened whipped cream, sprinkle\\nwith chopped nuts, and serve.\\n\\n\\nRECIPES FOR WHITE SAUCE\\n\\n66. Three white sauces are commonly used for different purposes, and in\\neach one of them milk is the basis. These sauces differ from one another\\nin thickness, and include _thin white sauce_, which is used for cream\\ntoast and soups; _medium white sauce_, which is used for dressing\\nvegetables and is flavored in various ways to accompany meats, patties,\\nor croquettes; and _thick white sauce_, which is used to mix with the\\nmaterials used for croquettes in order to hold them together. To insure\\nthe best results, the proportion of flour and liquid should be learned\\nfor each kind, and to avoid the formation of lumps the proper method of\\nmixing should be carefully followed out. A white sauce properly made is\\nperfectly smooth, and since only little care is needed to produce such a\\nresult it is inexcusable to serve a lumpy sauce. Also, nothing is more\\ndisagreeable than thick, pasty sauce, but this can be avoided by\\nemploying the right proportion of flour and milk. The ingredients and\\ntheir proportions for the various kinds of white sauce are as follows:\\n\\nTHIN WHITE SAUCE\\n\\n1 c. milk\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n\\nMEDIUM WHITE SAUCE\\n\\n1 c. milk\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n\\nTHICK WHITE SAUCE\\n\\n1 c. milk\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/4 c. (4 Tb.) flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n\\nIt will be easy to remember the proportions for these three sauces if it\\nis observed that each one doubles the previous one in the quantity of\\nflour used, the thin one having 1 tablespoonful to 1 cupful of milk, the\\nmedium one 2 tablespoonfuls to 1 cupful of milk, and the thick one 4\\ntablespoonfuls to 1 cupful of milk. To produce these sauces the\\ningredients may be combined in three different ways, each of which has\\nits advantages. These methods, which are here given, should be carefully\\nobserved, for they apply not only to the making of this particular\\nsauce, but to the combining of fat, starch, and liquid in any sauce.\\n\\n_Method 1_.--Heat the milk, being careful that it does not scorch. Brown\\nthe butter slightly in a saucepan, add the flour and salt, and stir the\\nmixture until it is perfectly smooth and has a deep cream color. Then\\nadd the hot milk gradually, stirring to prevent the formation of lumps.\\nCook 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the sauce from scorching.\\nSauce made according to this method does not require long cooking\\nbecause the flour added to the hot fat cooks quickly. In fact, it is a\\nvery desirable method, for the browned butter and the flour lend flavor\\nto the sauce. Many otherwise unattractive or rather tasteless foods can\\nbe made much more appetizing by the addition of white sauce made in\\nthis way.\\n\\n_Method 2_.--Put the milk on to heat. While this is heating, stir the\\nbutter, flour, and salt together until they are soft and well mixed;\\nthen add the hot milk to them slowly, stirring constantly. Place over\\nthe heat and finish cooking, or cook in a double boiler. Sauce made by\\nthis method requires longer cooking than the preceding one and it has\\nless flavor.\\n\\n_Method 3_.--Heat the milk, reserving a small portion. Stir the flour\\nsmooth with the cold milk and add it to the hot milk, stirring rapidly.\\nAdd the butter and the salt, and continue to stir if cooked over the\\nheat; if cooked in a double boiler, stir only until the mixture is\\ncompletely thickened and then continue to cook for 10 or 15 minutes.\\nWhen butter is added to the mixture in this way, it is likely to float\\non top, especially if too much is used. A better sauce may be made\\naccording to this method by using thin cream for the liquid and omitting\\nthe butter.\\n\\n\\nMILK, BUTTER, AND CHEESE (PART 1)\\n\\nEXAMINATION QUESTIONS\\n\\n(1) When milk is used in a meal, what kinds of food may be omitted?\\n\\n(2) Name the chief uses of milk in the dietary.\\n\\n(3) Why is it possible for a child to remain in normal condition if\\ngiven only milk for a long period of time?\\n\\n(4) Name the solids contained in milk and tell for what each one is\\nvaluable.\\n\\n(5) What causes milk to sour?\\n\\n(6) What are the characteristics of wholesome milk?\\n\\n(7) What is meant by the adulteration of milk?\\n\\n(8) What quality of milk is of the most importance to the health of\\nthose using milk?\\n\\n(9) (_a_) Why is dirty milk dangerous?

BUTTER is the fatty constituent of milk. It is obtained by skimming\\nor separating the cream from milk and churning it in order to make the\\nparticles of fat adhere to one another. Butter is used largely in the\\nhousehold as an article of food, for it is one of the most appetizing\\nand digestible forms of fat.\\n\\nTo supply the demand for butter, it is produced domestically in the home\\nand on farms and commercially in dairies and large establishments. The\\nprinciple of all churns used for butter making is practically the same.\\nThey simply agitate the cream so that the butter-fat globules in it are\\nbrought together in masses of such size as to enable the butter maker to\\nseparate them from the buttermilk. Butter is seasoned, or salted, to\\ngive it a desirable flavor and to improve its keeping qualities; it is\\nwashed, or worked, in order to distribute the salt evenly, to separate\\nfrom it as much of the curd and other non-fatty constituents of the\\ncream as can be conveniently removed, to bring it into a compact, waxy\\nmass, and to give it texture. The United States authorities have set a\\nstandard for the composition of butter, which allows this product to\\ncontain not more than 16 per cent. of water and requires it to have at\\nleast 82.5 per cent. of butter fat.\\n\\n2. ECONOMICAL USE OF BUTTER.--In the home, butter is used on the table\\nand in the cooking of many foods. Hardly any article of food has such\\ngeneral use as this one; in fact, a meal is usually considered to be\\nincomplete without it, both as an accompaniment to bread, rolls,\\nbiscuits, or whatever variety of these is used, and as an ingredient in\\nthe cooking of some foods that require fat. But butter is not cheap, so\\nthat the wise and economical use of this food in the home is a point\\nthat should not be overlooked by the housewife. This precaution is very\\nimportant, it having been determined that butter, as well as other fats,\\nis wasted to a great extent; and still it is true that no other material\\ncan be so economically utilized. The very smallest amount of any kind of\\nfat should be carefully saved, for there are numerous uses to which it\\ncan be put. Even though it is mixed with other food, it can always be\\nmelted out, clarified--that is, freed from foreign substances--and then\\nused for some purpose in cooking. The chief way in which butter is\\nwasted is in the unnecessary and improper use of it, points that a\\nlittle careful thought will do much to remedy.\\n\\n3. FLAVOR AND COMPOSITION OF BUTTER.--That the housewife may have an\\nunderstanding of the food substances found in butter and also learn how\\nto determine the quantity of butter needed for her family, she should\\nbecome familiar with the composition of this food. The flavor of butter\\ndepends to a great extent on the kind of cream from which it is made,\\nboth sweet and sour cream being used for this purpose. Of these two\\nkinds, sour cream is the preferable one, because it gives to the butter\\na desirable flavor. Still, the unsalted butter that is made from sweet\\ncream is apparently growing in favor, although it is usually more\\nexpensive than salted butter. The difference in price is due to the fact\\nthat unsalted butter spoils readily.\\n\\n4. So far as its food substances are concerned, butter is composed\\nlargely of fat, but it also contains water, protein in the form of\\ncasein, and mineral matter. The quantity of water contained in butter\\ndetermines to a large extent the weight of butter, since water is\\nheavier than fat; but as only 16 per cent, of water is allowed, butter\\nthat contains more water than this is considered to be adulterated. As\\nvery little milk is retained in butter, only a small percentage of\\nprotein is found in this food. However, a considerable quantity of\\nmineral salts are present, and these make it more valuable than most of\\nthe other fats. Because of the nature of its composition--a very high\\npercentage of fat and a low percentage of protein--butter is distinctly\\na fuel food, that is, a heat-producing food. Of course, there are\\ncheaper fats, some of which are even better heat-producing foods than\\nbutter, but as their flavor is not especially agreeable to some persons,\\nthey are not used so extensively.\\n\\nIn view of the nature of the composition of this food, an ounce of\\nbutter a day is the average allowance for each person when the diet of a\\nfamily contains meat and such other fats as lard, olive oil, etc. At the\\nmost, 1/2 pound of butter should be purchased each week for each member\\nof the family for table use, and fats cheaper than butter should be used\\nfor cooking purposes.\\n\\n5. PURCHASING BUTTER.--As in the case of milk, in order that the\\nhousewife may judge the quality of the butter she purchases, she will do\\nwell to look into the cleanliness and sanitary condition of the dairy\\nthat produces it. Too much attention cannot be given to this matter, for\\nif cream becomes contaminated from careless handling, the same\\ncontamination is liable to occur in the butter made from it. Butter that\\nis produced in dairies that make large quantities of it usually has not\\nmuch opportunity to become contaminated before it reaches the consumer,\\nfor it is generally pressed into 1-pound prints, and each one of these\\nis then wrapped and placed in a paper carton. On the other hand, the\\nfarmer and the dairyman doing a small business do not find it profitable\\nto install the equipment required to put up butter in this way, so they\\nusually pack their butter into firkins or crocks or make it into rolls.\\nWhen such butter goes to market, it is generally placed in a\\nrefrigerator with more butter of the same sort, some of which is good\\nand some bad. As butter absorbs any strong odor present in the\\nrefrigerator and is perhaps cut and weighed in a most unsanitary manner,\\nthe good becomes contaminated with the bad. While butter of this kind is\\nperhaps a few cents cheaper than that which is handled in a more\\nsanitary way, it is less desirable, and if possible should be avoided by\\nthe housewife. In case butter is obtained from a certain farm, the\\nconditions on that farm should be looked into for the same reason that\\nthe conditions in a dairy are investigated.\\n\\n6. To be able to select good butter, the housewife should also be\\nfamiliar with its characteristics. In color, butter to be good should be\\nan even yellow, neither too pale nor too bright, and should contain no\\nstreaks. The light streaks that are sometimes found in butter indicate\\ninsufficient working. As to odor, butter should be pleasing and\\nappetizing, any foreign or strong, disagreeable odor being extremely\\nobjectionable. Stale butter or that which is improperly kept develops\\nan acid called _butyric acid_, which gives a disagreeable odor and\\nflavor to butter and often renders it unfit for use.\\n\\n7. CARE OF BUTTER.--The precautions that the farmer and dairyman are\\ncalled on to observe in the making and handling of butter should be\\ncontinued by the housewife after she purchases butter for home use. The\\nchief point for her to remember is that butter should be kept as cold as\\npossible, because a low temperature prevents it from spoiling, whereas a\\nhigh one causes it to become soft and less appetizing. The most\\nsatisfactory place in which to keep butter is the refrigerator, where it\\nshould be placed in the compartment located directly under the ice and\\nin which the milk is kept, for here it will not come in contact with\\nfoods that might impart their flavors to it. Should no refrigerator be\\navailable, some other means of keeping butter cold must be resorted to,\\nsuch as a cool cellar or basement or a window box.\\n\\nThe way in which butter is bought determines to a certain extent the\\nmethod of caring for it. If it is bought in paper cartons, it should be\\nrewrapped and replaced in the carton each time some is cut off for use.\\nIn case it is bought in bulk, it should never be allowed to remain in\\nthe wooden dish in which it is often sold; rather, it should be put into\\na crock or a jar that can be tightly covered.\\n\\n8. Attention should also be given to butter that is cut from the supply\\nfor the table or for cooking purposes and that is not entirely used.\\nSuch butter should never be returned to the original supply, but should\\nbe kept in a separate receptacle and used for cooking. If it contains\\nforeign material, it can be clarified by allowing it to stand after it\\nhas melted until this has settled and then dipping or pouring the clear\\nfat from the top. Butter that has become rancid or has developed a bad\\nflavor need not be wasted either, for it can be made ready for use in\\ncooking simply by pouring boiling water over it, allowing it to cool,\\nand then removing the layer of fat that comes to the top. Such butter,\\nof course, cannot be used for serving on the table. Still, consideration\\non the part of the housewife to just such matters as these will prevent\\nmuch of the waste that prevails in the household in the use of\\nthis food.\\n\\n9. COOKING WITH BUTTER.--While some housewives make it a practice to use\\nbutter in cooking of all kinds, there are uses in which other fats are\\npreferable; or, in case butter is desired, there are certain points to\\nbe observed in its use. For instance, butter is rendered less digestible\\nby cooking it at a high temperature, as in frying or saut\\u00e9ing; also, it\\ncannot be used to any extent for the frying of foods, as it burns very\\nreadily. If it is used for saut\\u00e9ing, the dish is made much more\\nexpensive than is necessary, so that in most cases a cheaper fat should\\nbe employed for this purpose. In addition, a point to remember is that\\nthis fat should not be used to grease the pans in which cakes and hot\\nbreads are baked unless it is first melted, because the milk contained\\nin the butter burns easily; after it is melted, only the top fat should\\nbe used. When butter is desired for very rich cakes and for pastry, it\\nis usually washed in cold water to remove the milk. To neutralize the\\nsour milk contained in butter that is used for baking purposes, a little\\nsoda is sometimes employed.\\n\\nFurther economy can be exercised in the use of butter if a little\\nthought is given to the matter. For instance, when butter is melted and\\npoured over meat or fish that has been broiled or over vegetables that\\nhave been cooked in a plain way, much of it usually remains in the dish\\nand is wasted. Such butter can be utilized again. Since butter undergoes\\na change when it is cooked, it should be mixed with cooked foods to\\nflavor them, rather than be subjected to the temperature necessary\\nfor cooking.\\n\\nWhen butter is used for spreading sandwiches, it usually will be found\\nadvisable to soften the butter by creaming it with a spoon, but it\\nshould never be melted for this purpose.\\n\\n10. SERVING BUTTER.--When butter is used for the table, some\\nconsideration must be given to the serving of it. Probably the most\\nusual way of serving butter is to place a slice of it on a plate and\\nthen pass the plate with a knife to each person at the table. The\\nadvantage of this method is that each person can take the amount desired\\nand thus prevent waste. However, a still more desirable way of serving\\nbutter that is to be passed is to cut it into small cubes or squares or\\nto shape it into small balls and then serve it with a fork or a butter\\nknife. To prevent the pieces or balls of butter from melting in warm\\nweather, cracked ice may be placed on the butter dish with them. Butter\\ncut into cubes or squares may also be served on an individual butter\\ndish or an individual bread-and-butter plate placed at each person's\\nplace before the meal is served. Whichever plan is adopted, any\\nfragments of butter that remain on the plates after a meal should be\\ngathered up and used for cooking purposes.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG 1]\\n\\n11. Butter that comes in pound prints lends itself readily to the\\ncutting of small cubes or squares for serving. Such butter may be cut by\\ndrawing a string through the print or by using a knife whose cutting\\nedge is covered with paper, a small piece of the oiled paper such as\\nthat in which the butter is wrapped answering very well for\\nthis purpose.\\n\\nIf butter balls are desired for serving, they may be rolled with butter\\npaddles in the manner shown in Fig. 1. To make butter balls, put wads of\\nthe butter to be used into ice water so as to make them hard. Then place\\neach wad between the paddles, as shown, and give the paddles a circular\\nmotion. After a little practice, it will be a simple matter to make\\nbutter balls that will add to the attractiveness of any meal. Paddles\\nmade especially for this purpose can be purchased in all stores that\\nsell kitchen utensils.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\\n\\n12. Sometimes, for practical purposes, it is desired to know the\\nquantity of butter that is served to each person. In the case of print\\nbutter, this is a simple matter to determine. As shown in Fig. 2, first\\nmark the pound print in the center in order to divide it in half; after\\ncutting it into two pieces, cut each half into two, and finally each\\nfourth into two. With the pound print cut into eight pieces, divide and\\ncut each eighth into four pieces. As there will be thirty-two small\\npieces, each one will represent one thirty-second of a pound, or\\n1/2 ounce.\\n\\n\\nBUTTER SUBSTITUTES\\n\\n13. In about the year 1870, through a desire to procure a cheaper\\narticle than butter for the poorer classes of France, came the\\nmanufacture of the first substitute for butter. Since that time the use\\nof butter substitutes has gradually increased, until at the present time\\nmillions of pounds are consumed every year. A certain amount of\\nprejudice against their use exists, but much of this is unnecessary for\\nthey are less likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria than the\\npoorer qualities of butter. Then, too, they do not spoil so readily, and\\nfor this reason they can be handled with greater convenience\\nthan butter.\\n\\n14. OLEOMARGARINE.--The best substitute for butter and the one most\\nlargely used is called oleomargarine, which in the United States alone\\nconstitutes about two and 1/2 per cent. of all the fat used as butter.\\nThis fat is called by various other names, such as _margarine,_ and\\n_butterine_, but oleomargarine is the name by which the United States\\nauthorities recognize the product. It is made by churning fats other\\nthan butter fat with milk or cream until a butterlike consistency is\\nobtained. Originally, pure beef fat was employed for this purpose, and\\nwhile beef fat is used to a great extent at present, lard, cottonseed\\noil, coconut oil, and peanut oil are also used. Whatever fats are\\nselected are churned with milk, cream, and, for the finest grades, a\\nconsiderable percentage of the very best pure butter. After they are\\nchurned, the oleomargarine is worked, salted, and packed in the same\\nmanner as butter.\\n\\n15. The manufacture and sale of butter substitutes are controlled by\\nlaws that, while they do not specify the kind of fat to be used, state\\nthat all mixtures of butter with other fats must be sold as\\noleomargarine. They also require that a tax of 10 cents a pound be paid\\non all artificially colored oleomargarine; therefore, while coloring\\nmatter is used in some cases, this product is usually sold without\\ncoloring. In such an event, coloring matter is given with each pound of\\noleomargarine that is sold. Before using the oleomargarine, this\\ncoloring matter is simply worked into the fat until it is\\nevenly colored.\\n\\n16. RENOVATED BUTTER.--Another substitute that is sometimes used to take\\nthe place of the best grades of butter is renovated, or process,\\nbutter. This is obtained by purifying butter that is dirty and rancid\\nand that contains all sorts of foreign material and then rechurning it\\nwith fresh cream or milk. The purifying process consists in melting the\\nbutter, removing the scum from the top, as well as the buttermilk,\\nbrine, and foreign materials that settle, and then blowing air through\\nthe fat to remove any odors that it might contain. Butter that is thus\\npurified is replaced on the market, but in some states the authorities\\nhave seen fit to restrict its sale. While such restrictions are without\\ndoubt justifiable, it is possible to buy butter that is more\\nobjectionable than renovated, or process, butter, but that has no\\nrestriction on it.\\n\\n17. METHOD OF TESTING BUTTER SUBSTITUTES.--Very often oleomargarine and\\nprocess butter bear such a close resemblance to genuine butter that it\\nis almost impossible to detect the difference. However, there is a\\nsimple test by which these substitutes can always be distinguished from\\nbutter, and this should be applied whenever there is any doubt about the\\nmatter. To make this test, place the fat in a tablespoon or a small dish\\nand heat it directly over the flame until it boils, stirring it\\noccasionally to assist in the melting. If it is oleomargarine or process\\nbutter, it will sputter noisily and take on a curdled appearance;\\nwhereas, if it is butter, it will melt and even boil without sputtering\\nalthough it foams to a certain extent.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nCHEESE\\n\\nCHARACTERISTICS AND CARE OF CHEESE\\n\\n18. ORIGIN, PRODUCTION, AND USE OF CHEESE.--Cheese is a product that is\\nmanufactured from the solids of milk, and it provides a valuable food.\\nThe making of cheese was known in ancient times, it having probably\\noriginated through a desire to utilize an oversupply of milk. When\\ncheese was first made, the fact that bacteria were present was not\\nknown, nor were the reasons for the spoiling of milk understood; but it\\nwas learned that milk can be kept if most of its water is removed. This\\ndiscovery was very important, for it led to various methods of making\\ncheese and proved that cheese making was a satisfactory and convenient\\nmeans of storing nourishment in a form that was not bulky and that would\\nkeep for long periods of time. From a very small beginning, the\\ndifferent methods of making cheese became popular, until at the present\\ntime more than three hundred varieties are made and their manufacture\\nforms one of the large industries of the world.\\n\\nIn the United States, nearly all the cheese used up to about 50 years\\nago was made on farms, and to a great extent by housewives, but about\\nthat time a factory for the making of this product was started in the\\nstate of New York, and it proved a profitable enterprise. From this\\nbeginning, the business of making cheese commercially in this country\\nhas grown until now cheese is almost entirely a factory-made product, in\\nthe manufacture of which the states of New York and Wisconsin lead.\\n\\n19. In either the commercial or the home production of cheese, skim milk\\nwith all or part of the cream removed is used for some varieties, while\\nwhole milk is used for others, the composition depending largely on the\\nkind of milk that is employed. Rennet is added to the milk to coagulate\\nit, and then the curd, from which nearly all the water is removed, is\\nallowed to ripen. To produce characteristic odors, flavors, and\\nconsistency, various coloring and flavoring materials, as well as\\nbacteria, are added to the curd. The action of these bacteria is really\\nthe chief factor in the making of cheese and they are therefore not only\\ndesirable but necessary. Non-desirable bacteria, however, result in the\\nformation of bad odors, flavors, and gases in the finished product and\\nthese must be carefully guarded against by cheese makers.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\\n\\n20. Cheese offers a valuable source of nutriment for the body, because\\nits food value ranks high. As is shown in Fig. 3, the food value in 1\\npound of cheese is equivalent to that in 2 pounds of beef, that in 24\\neggs, or that in 4 pounds of fish. The use of cheese, however, is not\\nnearly so great as its food value warrants, the amount used in the\\nUnited States per capita being only about 3-1/2 pounds annually. This is\\na condition that should be overcome, for there is a large variety of\\nways in which cheese can be used to advantage in the diet. When eaten\\nraw, it is very appetizing, and when used with soups, sauces, and foods\\nthat have a bland taste, it lends additional flavor and makes an\\nespecially attractive dish. In addition, the fact that it is an\\neconomical food and can be conveniently kept and stored should recommend\\nits frequent use.\\n\\n21. COMPOSITION OF CHEESE.--Since cheese is a product of milk, it is\\nsomewhat similar to milk in composition, but the change that occurs in\\nthe formation of cheese causes some differences. Nearly all the water\\npresent in milk is removed during the manufacture of cheese, so that\\nthis product becomes a concentrated food made up of all the nourishment\\nthat milk contains except small amounts of albumin, milk sugar, and\\nmineral matter. These, because they are in solution in the water, are\\nlost when the whey is separated from the curd. The food substances that\\noccur in the largest amounts are fat and protein in the form of casein,\\nwhich is the tissue-building material of milk. Cheese made from milk\\nthat contains some cream has in it a greater amount of fat than that\\nmade from completely skimmed milk. Besides these two chief food\\nsubstances, cheese contains a small amount of milk sugar, mineral\\nmatter, and water.\\n\\n22. On account of the large quantity of protein found in cheese, this\\nfood can readily take the place of meat in the diet; in fact, it has\\nsome decided advantages over meat. As has been pointed out, cheese\\nyields more than twice as much food value as an equal weight of beef.\\nThen, too, the buying and care of cheese are much simpler matters than\\nthe buying and care of meat. As it does not require the low temperature\\nthat meat requires and does not spoil so readily, it can be bought in\\nconsiderable quantity and used as desired without danger of spoiling and\\nloss. In addition, the use of cheese as food does not require so much\\nskill in preparation as meat does, nor is there loss of flavor and\\nnutriment in its preparation, as is often the case with meat.\\n\\n23. QUALITY OF CHEESE.--Every variety of cheese has its own standard and\\nquality, some being hard and dry, others moist, and still others very\\nsoft. The difference in quality is due to the way in which the curd is\\ncoagulated, the amount of pressure that is put on it, and the ripening\\nof the cheese. The holes that often occur in cheese and give it a porous\\nappearance are formed by gas, which is the product of the growth of\\nbacteria. A large number of very small holes in cheese indicate that\\nthe milk used to make it was not clean and contained many kinds of\\nbacteria. This condition could be overcome by the use of absolutely\\nclean milk; indeed, milk of this kind is as necessary for the production\\nof good cheese as it is for the making of good butter. Certain cheeses,\\nsuch as Limburger and Roquefort, have a typical odor and flavor, the\\nodor being due to bacteria and the flavor to mold. These are carefully\\ngrown and introduced into the cheese during its manufacture.\\n\\n24. CARE OF CHEESE.--The very strong odor and flavor that characterize\\ncheese make it necessary that care be given to cheese in the home in\\norder to prevent it from coming in contact with other foods and\\ntransmitting its odor and flavor to them. The best place to keep cheese,\\nparticularly the soft varieties, is in the refrigerator, where it should\\nbe placed in a closed receptacle and kept as far as possible from foods\\nthat are easily tainted. It is well to avoid a damp place for the\\nkeeping of cheese, as mold frequently develops on the outside when too\\nmuch moisture is present; but in case mold does appear it can be removed\\nby cutting a thin slice from the side on which it has grown. On the\\nother hand, cheese that is kept in a dry place becomes hard and dry\\nunless it is wrapped in oiled paper or a damp cloth. However, such\\ncheese need not be thrown away, for there are numerous uses,\\nparticularly in cooking, to which it can be put.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nKINDS OF CHEESE\\n\\nCLASSIFICATION OF VARIETIES\\n\\n25. The cheese used in the United States may be included under two\\nleading classes, namely, _foreign cheese_ and _domestic cheese_. Since\\nthe foreign cheeses are imported, they are more expensive than the\\ncheeses made here, and should not be bought if cheese is to be used as\\nan economical article of food. They are valuable chiefly for their\\nflavor and are generally bought for this reason. The domestic cheeses\\ncan be used in larger quantities, for, besides being less expensive,\\nthey are usually of a milder type and are more easily digested. To\\nenable the housewife to become familiar with the principal varieties of\\neach of these classes, a discussion of them, including their names,\\ncharacteristics, and, in some cases, their use and the method of\\nmaking, is here given. In addition, there are shown in colors, in Fig.\\n4, a large number of cheeses, together with a print of butter _o_, which\\nserves to illustrate the irregular surface that is exposed when good\\nbutter is broken apart.\\n\\n\\nIMPORTED CHEESE\\n\\n26. Each of the European countries has originated its own peculiar kind\\nof cheese, which remains representative of a certain people or locality.\\nThe majority of these cheeses have met with so much favor in the United\\nStates that large quantities of them are continually imported. A few of\\nthem have been copied here with success, but others have not been\\nsuccessfully made. While these are not in such common use as the\\ndomestic cheeses, it is well for every one to know their names and the\\ncharacteristics by which they can be identified.\\n\\n27. ENGLISH CHEESE.--Chief among the kinds of cheeses made in England is\\nCHEDDAR CHEESE, which is illustrated at _a_, Fig. 4. It is rich,\\ndouble-thick cream cheese, ranging from a pale to a dark yellow,\\nalthough when uncolored it may be white. Such cheese, when fresh, has a\\nmilk flavor, but when it is well ripened it has a characteristic sharp\\ntaste. New Cheddar cheese is soft, but not waxy, in texture and may\\nreadily be shaved or broken into small pieces; when it is well ripened,\\nit may be grated. English Cheddar cheese is not unlike AMERICAN CHEDDAR\\nCHEESE, or, as it is commonly called, _American cream cheese_, which is\\nshown by _b_. In fact the American variety is made according to the\\nmethod used for the English. Owing to its characteristics, flavor, and\\nabundance, Cheddar cheese, both English and American, is the kind that\\nis used most extensively in the United States.\\n\\nENGLISH DAIRY CHEESE, shown at _d_, is similar to Cheddar cheese,\\nalthough it has a reddish color and, on account of the method of\\nmanufacture, it is harder. This kind of cheese lends itself well to\\ncooking, as it may be easily grated.\\n\\nCHESHIRE CHEESE, a well-known English variety, is a dry cream cheese\\nmade from whole cow's milk. It is deep yellow or red in color, similar\\nin flavor to Cheddar cheese, and is used in much the same manner.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSTILTON CHEESE, shown at _m_, is a hard cheese made from cow's milk to\\nwhich cream has been added and which is coagulated with rennet. Mold\\nis introduced into this cheese, so that it resembles Roquefort cheese,\\nwhich is shown at _j_.\\n\\n28. HOLLAND CHEESE.--The variety of cheese shown at _e_, Fig. 4, is\\nknown as EDAM CHEESE. It is a hard rennet cheese of a red color and is\\nmild in flavor. This kind of cheese is molded into the shape of a ball,\\nthe outside of which is usually dyed red, and will keep for a long\\nperiod of time. Edam cheese is one of the important products of the\\nNetherlands, and while it is seldom used in cookery in the homes of this\\ncountry, it is served at the table. Usually a section of the top is cut\\noff to serve as a lid while the inside is scooped out as needed.\\nSometimes, after most of the cheese has been removed, the hollow shell\\nis stuffed with macaroni or rice that has been cooked and seasoned and\\nthe food then baked in the shell.\\n\\n29. FRENCH CHEESES.--Among the French cheeses, the variety called\\nGRUY\\u00c8RE CHEESE, which is shown at _f_, Fig. 4, is well liked. It is\\nusually made of skim milk, has a yellow color and a mild, sweetish\\nflavor, and contains large holes like those found in Swiss and Emmenthal\\ncheeses, varieties that are very similar to it. Like these cheeses,\\nGruy\\u00e8re cheese may be used in cooking or served without cooking, being\\nused considerably in the making of sandwiches.\\n\\nBRIE CHEESE is a French variety of very soft cheese, with a strong\\nflavor and odor. It is made from whole or partly skimmed cow's milk\\ncoagulated by means of rennet. This kind of cheese is used mostly as an\\naccompaniment to other foods.\\n\\nCAMEMBERT CHEESE, which is shown at _h_, is also a soft cheese. It is\\nmade by practically the same process as Brie cheese and is used in the\\nsame way. This cheese has a typical odor. Its rind is thick and dry, but\\nits center is very soft, being sometimes almost liquid.\\n\\nNEUFCH\\u00c2TEL CHEESE, which is shown at _i_, is a soft rennet cheese made\\nfrom cow's milk. It is made at Neufch\\u00e2tel-en-Bray, France, and not at\\nNeufch\\u00e2tel, Switzerland. This variety of cheese is wrapped in tin-foil\\nand sold in small packages. It is used chiefly for salads, sandwiches,\\netc. As it does not keep well after the package is opened, the entire\\ncontents should be used at one time.\\n\\nROQUEFORT CHEESE, which is shown at _j_, is a hard, highly flavored\\ncheese made from sheep's milk coagulated with rennet. It has a marbled\\nappearance, which is due to a greenish mold that is introduced.\\nRoquefort cheese is frequently served with crackers at the end of a\\nmeal, and is well liked by many persons.\\n\\n30. ITALIAN CHEESES.--From Italy is imported a cheese, called PARMESAN\\nCHEESE, that is used extensively for flavoring soups and macaroni\\ndishes. This cheese, which is shown at _g_, Fig. 4, is very hard and\\ngranular and, provided it is well made, it will keep for years. Owing to\\nits characteristics, it may be easily grated. It can be bought by the\\npound and grated as it is needed, or it can be secured already grated\\nin bottles.\\n\\nGORGONZOLA, another Italian cheese, is shown at _k_. It is not unlike\\nRoquefort in appearance and in use, but it is made from whole cow's milk\\ncoagulated with rennet. Into this cheese is also introduced a mold that\\ngives its center a streaked or mottled appearance.\\n\\n31. SWISS CHEESES.--Possibly the best known cheese imported from\\nSwitzerland is the variety known as SWISS, or SWITZER, CHEESE. This kind\\nof cheese has different names, depending on the district of Switzerland\\nin which it is made. Nevertheless all of them are similar and have a\\nmild, sweet flavor. Swiss cheese may be readily recognized by its pale\\nyellow color and the presence of large holes, although it resembles\\nGruy\\u00e8re cheese very closely.\\n\\nEMMENTHAL CHEESE is a variety of fairly hard cheese that originated in\\nSwitzerland, but is now made in many other countries. It is similar to\\nSwiss cheese, being made from whole cow's milk and characterized by\\nlarge holes about 3 inches apart.\\n\\nSAPSAGO CHEESE, shown at _n_, Fig. 4, is a skim-milk cheese made in\\nSwitzerland. It is a very hard cheese, and therefore suitable for\\ngrating. In the process of making this cheese, melilot, a clover-like\\nherb, is added, and this gives the cheese a green color and a\\npeculiar flavor.\\n\\n32. BELGIAN CHEESE.--A cheese that originated in Belgium, but is now\\nmanufactured in other countries, is the variety known as LIMBURG, or\\nLIMBURGER, CHEESE, cheese, which is shown at _l_, Fig. 4. It is a soft\\nrennet cheese made from whole cow's milk. It is very strong in taste and\\nsmell, due to putrefactive germs that are added to the milk in its\\nmanufacture.\\n\\n\\nDOMESTIC CHEESE\\n\\n33. In the United States, efforts that have been exerted to make cheeses\\nsimilar to some of those produced in Europe have to a certain extent\\nbeen successful. American cheese makers have succeeded in making\\nseveral soft cream cheeses that resemble Neufch\\u00e2tel, some of which are\\nspiced or flavored with pimiento, olives, etc. In addition, Limburg and\\nSwiss cheeses have been successfully manufactured in Wisconsin, and\\nBrie, Neufch\\u00e2tel, and Camembert have been copied and are produced in New\\nYork. Pineapple cheese, while of American origin, is really very much\\nlike English Cheddar cheese, except that it is harder. But while these\\nfancy cheeses are desired by some persons and have a moderately large\\nsale, the cheese for which there is the most demand in America is the\\nso-called American Cheddar cheese, which, as has been stated, is made\\naccording to the method used for English Cheddar cheese.\\n\\n34. AMERICAN CHEDDAR CHEESE.--Since American Cheddar cheese is the kind\\nthat is commonly used in this country, the way in which it is made will\\nbe well to know. The milk used for this kind of cheese is first\\ninspected as to cleanliness and the extent of fermentation it has\\nundergone, and when these points are ascertained, it is _ripened_; that\\nis, allowed to sour to a certain degree of acidity. At this stage,\\ncoloring matter is added, after which the milk is prepared for setting\\nby bringing it to a certain temperature. With the temperature at the\\nright point, rennet is added to coagulate the milk, or form the curd.\\nThe milk is then allowed to remain undisturbed until the action of the\\nrennet is at a certain point, when the curd is cut into little\\ncube-shaped pieces by drawing two sets of knives through it and thus is\\nseparated from the whey. As soon as the curd is cut, the temperature of\\nthe mass is raised to help make the curd firm and to cause the little\\ncubes to retain their firmness, and during the entire heating process\\nthe whole mass is stirred constantly to assist in the separation from\\nthe whey. When the curd is sufficiently firm, the whey is removed and\\nthe particles of curd are allowed to adhere and form into a solid mass.\\nIf necessary, the curd is cut again into small pieces to get rid of the\\nexcess whey; but if the curd is too dry, the pieces must be piled up\\nuntil they are four or five deep. During this process, which is known as\\nthe _cheddaring_ of the cheese, the curd is treated until it is of the\\nproper texture to be _milled_, that is, put into a mill and ground into\\nsmall pieces. The object of milling the curd is to cut it into pieces\\nsmall enough to permit of uniform salting and the further escape of\\nwhey. When the curd has been brought to this point, it is salted and\\nthen pressed into molds. Finally, it is wrapped and cured, or ripened.\\n\\n35. BRICK CHEESE.--Another American cheese that seems to meet with a\\npopular demand is brick cheese. This kind of cheese, which is\\nillustrated at _c_, Fig. 4, gets its name from the fact that it is\\npressed into \\\"bricks\\\" under the weight of one or two bricks. It is made\\nfrom sweet milk, coagulated with rennet, cut with curd knives, and\\nheated in the whey to firm it. Brick cheese is mild in flavor and of a\\nmoderately close texture. It is used chiefly as an accompaniment to\\nother foods.\\n\\n36. AMERICAN HOME-MADE CHEESE.--The making of Cheddar cheese and brick\\ncheese is, of course, done commercially, but there is a kind of cheese\\nthat can be made very conveniently in the home. This home-made cheese,\\nwhich is generally known as COTTAGE CHEESE, affords an excellent way in\\nwhich to utilize left-over sour milk, particularly if a quart or more\\ncan be obtained at one time; smaller quantities can generally be used\\nfor baking purposes.\\n\\nIf properly made, such cheese is very digestible. As it can be seasoned\\nand served in a variety of ways, it makes a delightful addition to\\nlunches or other light meals in which a protein dish, such as meat, is\\nundesirable. Skim milk does very well for this kind of cheese, so that\\nif the sour milk that is to be used has cream on it, the cream should be\\nremoved before the cheese is made; otherwise, it will remain in the whey\\nand be lost. In case cream is desired to improve the texture and flavor\\nof the cheese, it should be added after the cheese is made.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\\n\\n37. To make cottage cheese, allow a quantity of sour milk to clabber,\\nthat is, become curdled, and then place it on the back of the stove in a\\nthick vessel, such as a crock, until the whey begins to appear on the\\ntop, turning it occasionally so that it will heat very slowly and\\nevenly. Do not allow the temperature to rise above 90 degrees\\nFahrenheit, or the curd will become tough and dry. Remember that the two\\nthings on which the success of this product depends are the flavor of\\nthe milk used and the proper heating of it. No difficulty will be\\nencountered in the heating of the milk if a coal or a wood stove is\\nused, but in case a gas stove must be used, the vessel containing the\\nmilk should be placed in a larger one containing warm water and the milk\\nshould be heated in this manner until the curd and the whey begin to\\nseparate. At this point, pour off all the whey possible, and turn the\\ncurd into a cloth bag or a colander lined with cloth, as shown in Fig.\\n5, and allow any remaining whey to drip out. If, after the whey is\\nremoved, the curd tastes sour, wash it with warm water and allow it to\\ndrip again. Then season it with salt to suit the taste and, provided\\ncream is desired, add it at this time, using sweet or sour cream. To\\nwork in the cream, press it into the curd with a spoon until the cheese\\nis quite smooth.\\n\\nCheese made in this way may be flavored with anything desirable. For\\ninstance, chopped pimiento, parsley, olives, or nuts improve the flavor\\nof the cheese very much and make a very appetizing combination. The dry\\ncurd mixed with any of these makes a delightful salad when it is pressed\\ninto balls, garnished with lettuce, and served with salad dressing.\\n\\n38. JUNKET COTTAGE CHEESE.--Another variety of cottage cheese can be\\nprepared by using sweet milk and forming the curd with a junket tablet,\\none tablet being required for each quart of milk. To make cheese of this\\nkind, heat the milk until it is lukewarm, or not over 98 degrees\\nFahrenheit, and then add the junket tablet dissolved in cold milk or\\nwater. Keep the milk warm until the curd forms, and then break up the\\ncurd with a spoon and pour the whole mass into a bag or a colander lined\\nwith cloth. When all the whey is drained out, the curd, which will be\\nsweet, can be seasoned in any desired way or mixed with cream and\\nserved. If more flavor is preferred, the curd may be allowed to sour or\\nmay be mixed with sour cream.\\n\\n39. BUTTERMILK CREAM CHEESE.--A slight variation from the cottage\\ncheeses just described is buttermilk cream cheese. This cheese is formed\\nfrom the curd of buttermilk, which is finer in texture and not so likely\\nto become tough as that formed from ordinary sour milk. To prepare\\nbuttermilk cream cheese, warm the buttermilk slowly, being careful not\\nto allow the temperature to rise beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit. As the\\nmilk is heated, the curd will form and will gradually sink to the bottom\\nof the vessel. After this occurs, remove the whey and mix the curd with\\na little thick cream. The result will be a mixture having a delightfully\\ncreamy consistency.\\n\\n\\nSERVING CHEESE\\n\\n40. Cheese does not lend itself readily to many ways of serving, still\\nit frequently adds zest to many foods. When grated, it may be passed\\nwith tomato or vegetable soup and sprinkled in to impart an unusual\\nflavor. In this form it may also be served with macaroni and other\\nItalian pastes, provided cheese has not been included in the preparation\\nof such foods. When sliced, little slices may be served nicely with any\\nkind of pie or pastry and with some puddings, such as steamed fruit\\npuddings. Thin slices or squares of cheese and crackers served with\\ncoffee after the dessert add a finishing touch to many meals. It will be\\nwell to note that crackers to be served with cheese should always be\\ncrisp. Unless they have just been taken from a fresh package, crackers\\ncan be improved by placing them in a moderate oven for a few minutes\\nbefore serving. Also, firm crackers that do not crumble easily are best\\nto serve with cheese, water crackers being especially desirable.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nRECIPES FOR CHEESE DISHES\\n\\nEFFECT OF COOKING ON CHEESE\\n\\n41. Because cheese is a highly concentrated food, it is generally\\nconsidered to be indigestible; but this matter can be remedied by mixing\\nthe cheese with other foods and thus separating it into small particles\\nthat are more readily digested. The way in which this may be done\\ndepends on the nature of the cheese. Any of the dry cheeses or any of\\nthe moist cheeses that have become dry may be grated or broken into\\nbits, but as it is difficult to treat the moist ones in this way, they\\nmust be brought to a liquid state by means of heat before they can be\\nadded to other foods. The cooking of cheese, however, has an effect on\\nthis food that should be thoroughly understood.\\n\\nIt will be well to note, therefore, that the application of heat to the\\nform of protein found in cheese causes this food substance to coagulate\\nand harden, as in the case of the albumen of eggs. In the process of\\ncoagulation, the first effect is the melting of the cheese, and when it\\nhas been brought to this semiliquid state it can be easily combined with\\nother foods, such as milk, eggs, soups, and sauces. In forming such\\ncombinations, the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda\\nhelps to blend the foods. Another characteristic of cheese that\\ninfluences the cooking of it is that the fat it contains melts only at a\\nlow temperature, so that, on the whole, the methods of preparation that\\nrequire a low temperature are the best for cooking these foods. However,\\na precaution that should be taken whenever cheese is heated is not to\\ncook it too long, for long cooking makes it hard and leathery in\\nconsistency, and cheese in this state is difficult to digest.\\n\\n\\nVARIETY OF CHEESE DISHES\\n\\n42. As has already been learned, cheese lends itself very readily to a\\nlarge variety of cooked dishes. For instance, it may be grated and\\nsprinkled on the top of mashed or creamed potatoes and then browned by\\nplacing the dish in the oven. When it is grated or sliced, it may be\\narranged between the layers of macaroni or other food used to make a\\nscalloped dish. Soups and sauces flavored with cheese are especially\\nappetizing, a cream sauce of this kind served over toast or rice making\\nan excellent luncheon dish. Toast or crackers spread with cheese and\\nplaced in the oven just long enough for the cheese to melt are delicious\\nto serve with a salad course or with tea. To assist in the preparation\\nof such combinations, as well as other cheese dishes, a number of\\nrecipes are here given. In making up these recipes, it will be well to\\nnote that unless the variety of cheese is stated explicitly, use should\\nbe made of American Cheddar cheese, or, as it is often called, _American\\ncream cheese_, or _store cheese_. Of course, some similar hard cheese\\ncould be used if desired, but the kind mentioned is recommended for the\\nsake of economy.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\\n\\n43. CHEESE BONBONS.--A combination of cheese and nuts in the form of\\ncheese bonbons, besides being very tasty, is highly nutritious, since\\nboth the cheese and the nuts used in making them are high in food\\nvalue. Such bonbons, which are illustrated in Fig. 6, may be served with\\na light salad, such as a vegetable or a fruit salad, to add food value\\nto the dish, or they may be served with wafers to take the place of a\\nsalad, when a small amount of some kind of tart jelly goes nicely with\\nthem. If the dessert for the dinner has been a very light one, these\\nbonbons may be served with coffee and wafers after the dessert. They may\\nbe made as follows:\\n\\nCHEESE BONBONS\\n(Sufficient for Twelve Bonbons)\\n\\n1 pkg. Neufch\\u00e2tel or cream cheese\\n2 Tb. finely chopped pimiento\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nFew grains of paprika\\n1/3 c. half English-walnut meats\\n\\nWork the cheese smooth with the pimiento and other seasoning, and if the\\nmixture is too dry add a little cream. Shape this into small balls,\\npress each ball flat, and then place a half nut on top of each. If the\\npimiento is not desired, it may be omitted.\\n\\n44. CHEESE SOUFFL\\u00c9.--As a dish that will take the place of meat in a\\nlight meal is often desired, cheese souffl\\u00e9, which is comparatively high\\nin food value, finds much favor. This dish contains milk, eggs, and\\ncheese, as is shown in the accompanying recipe, and so may actually be\\nconsidered as a protein dish and used accordingly. Souffl\\u00e9 is served in\\nthe dish in which it is baked, but if it is quite firm and is to be\\neaten at once, it may be removed from the ramekin to a plate.\\n\\nCHEESE SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 Tb. butter\\n4 Tb. flour\\n1-1/4 c. milk\\n3/4 c. grated cheese\\nDash of paprika\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n3 eggs\\n\\nMelt the butter, add the flour, mix well, and then gradually add the\\nmilk, which should be scalded. To this sauce add the cheese, paprika,\\nand salt. When thoroughly mixed, remove from the fire and add the beaten\\nyolks of eggs, beating rapidly. Cool and fold in the stiffly beaten\\nwhites of the eggs. Pour into a buttered baking dish or in ramekins and\\nbake 20 minutes in a slow oven. Serve at once.\\n\\n45. CHEESE OMELET.--Grated cheese added to an omelet gives it a\\ndelightful flavor. Since such an omelet is a high-protein dish, it\\nshould never be served in the same meal in which meat, fish, or other\\nprotein foods are served, but should be used as the main dish of a\\nluncheon or a light supper.\\n\\nCHEESE OMELET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Four)\\n\\n4 eggs\\n4 Tb. hot water\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n2 Tb. bread crumbs\\n1 c. grated cheese\\n1 Tb. butter\\n\\nBeat the egg yolks thoroughly and add to them the hot water, salt,\\ncrumbs, and cheese. Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry, and\\nfold them carefully into the yolk mixture. Heat the butter in an omelet\\npan. Pour in the mixture, brown very slowly over the heat, and then\\nplace in the oven to cook the top. Serve at once.\\n\\n46. CHEESE SAUCE.--To give a distinctive flavor to white sauce, cheese\\nis often added to it. A sauce flavored in this way lends itself nicely\\nto the garnishing of croquettes or souffl\\u00e9s, and it will be found quite\\ntasty if it is served over some vegetables, such as steamed cauliflower,\\nmashed potatoes, or rice served as a vegetable.

CHEESE TOAST.--When toast has added to it eggs, milk, and cheese, as\\nin the recipe here given, it is sufficiently high in protein to serve as\\na meat substitute and is a particularly good dish for a light meal. It\\ncombines well with a vegetable salad for luncheon and is an excellent\\ndish to serve for Sunday night supper, when very little else need be\\nserved with it.\\n\\nCHEESE TOAST\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. milk\\n4 Tb. flour\\n4 Tb. butter\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n3/4 c. grated cheese\\n2 hard-cooked eggs\\n6 squares of toast\\n\\nMake a white sauce of the milk, flour, butter, and salt, and to it add\\n1/2 cupful of the grated cheese and the egg whites chopped fine.

Place in hot oven\\nor under a broiler until the cheese melts a little. Serve hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\\n\\n48. WELSH RAREBIT.--Whenever a dish that can be made in a chafing dish\\nis desired, Welsh rarebit is immediately thought of. This is possibly\\ndue to the fact that this tasty cheese dish is very often served at\\nevening parties, when a crowd may gather around a table and enjoy the\\npreparation of this food in the chafing dish. This kind of cooking\\nutensil, together with its outfit, which consists of a long-handled\\nspoon and fork, is shown in Fig. 7. As will be observed, a chafing dish\\nconsists of a frame to which is attached a lamp that provides the heat,\\na pan in which water is placed, another pan with a handle in which the\\nfood is cooked, and a cover. The heat for cooking is furnished by\\nalcohol, although it is possible to get chafing dishes that are heated\\nby electricity. Chafing dishes are used by many housewives, for in\\naddition to the use mentioned, they serve very well for the making of\\npractically any kind of creamed dish, including those in which sea foods\\nand vegetables are used, as well as for the saut\\u00e9ing of foods. It should\\nnot be understood, however, that Welsh rarebit must be made in a chafing\\ndish, for this food can be prepared as well in a heavy frying pan or a\\ndouble boiler; nor should it be taken for granted that it is served only\\nat parties, for it may be served as the main dish for luncheon or\\nsupper. Rarebit is often flavored with ale or beer, but this is not\\nrequired to make an appetizing dish, as the following recipe shows.\\n\\nWELSH RAREBIT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1 c. milk\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. paprika\\n1/2 lb. cheese cut into small pieces\\n6 slices of toast or 6 wafers\\n\\nMelt the butter, add to it the flour, and stir until smooth. Gradually\\nadd the milk, and cook for a few minutes; then add the salt, paprika,\\nand cheese, stirring until the cheese is melted. The finished rarebit\\nshould not be stringy. Pour over the toast or wafers and serve.\\n\\n49. ENGLISH MONKEY.--Another cheese dish that is frequently made in a\\nchafing dish and served from it is English monkey, but this may likewise\\nbe made with ordinary kitchen utensils and served directly on plates\\nfrom the kitchen or from a bowl on the table. A dish of this kind is\\nmost satisfactory if it is served as soon as the sauce is poured over\\ntoast or wafers and before they have had time to become soaked. English\\nmonkey may be made according to the following recipe and served for the\\nsame purposes as Welsh rarebit.\\n\\nENGLISH MONKEY\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. bread crumbs\\n1 c. milk\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1/2 c. soft cheese cut into small pieces\\n1 egg\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n6 buttered wafers\\n\\nSoak the bread crumbs in the milk. Melt the butter and add to it the\\ncheese, stirring until the cheese is melted. Then add the soaked crumbs,\\nthe slightly beaten egg, and the salt. Cook for a few minutes and pour\\nover wafers and serve. If desired, toast may be used in place of\\nthe wafers.\\n\\n50. CHEESE-AND-MACARONI LOAF.--Macaroni combined with cheese makes a\\nhigh-protein dish that very readily takes the place of meat and that may\\nbe served as the main dish in a dinner. If this combination is made into\\na loaf and baked well in an oblong bread pan, it may be turned out on a\\nplatter and cut into slices. In case a loaf is not desired, it may be\\nbaked in a baking dish and served directly from that. In either form,\\nit is made more appetizing by the addition of a tomato sauce.\\n\\nCHEESE-AND-MACARONI LOAF\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1/2 c. macaroni (inch lengths)\\n1 c. milk\\n1 c. bread crumbs\\n2 Tb. chopped green peppers\\n1 Tb. chopped onion\\n1 Tb. chopped parsley\\n2 eggs\\n2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1 c. grated cheese\\n1 Tb. butter\\n\\nCook the macaroni according to the directions given in _Cereals_. When\\nit is thoroughly soft, drain off the water and mix the macaroni with the\\nmilk, bread crumbs, green pepper, onion, parsley, well-beaten egg, salt,\\npepper, and grated cheese. Place in a baking dish, dot the top with\\nbutter, and bake in a moderate oven until the mixture is set. Serve with\\nor without sauce, as desired.\\n\\n51. CHEESE FONDUE.--A dish that is very similar to cheese souffl\\u00e9 and\\nthat must be served as soon as it comes from the oven in order to avoid\\nshrinking is cheese fondue. It satisfactorily takes the place of meat in\\na light meal, and may be served from a large dish or from individual\\nbaking dishes with or without sauce, as desired.\\n\\nCHEESE FONDUE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 1/2 c. soft bread crumbs\\n1 1/2 c. grated cheese\\n1 c. hot milk\\n4 eggs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n\\nMix the bread crumbs and cheese, and add them to the hot milk, beaten\\negg yolks, and salt. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Bake in a\\nbuttered baking dish for about 30 minutes in a moderate oven. Serve\\nat once.\\n\\n52. CHEESE DREAMS.--If something delicious to serve with fruit or salad\\nis desired for luncheon or Sunday night supper, the accompanying recipe\\nfor cheese dreams should be tried. They should be served at once on\\nbeing taken from the stove, because as soon as they cool the cheese\\nhardens and they are not appetizing. Cheese dreams may be saut\\u00e9d or\\nprepared in a broiler or an oven, but if they are saut\\u00e9d, they may be\\nmade in a chafing dish.\\n\\nCHEESE DREAMS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n12 thinly cut slices of bread\\nButter\\nCheese sliced 1/8 in. thick\\n\\nSpread the bread thinly with butter and make sandwiches by placing a\\nslice of cheese between two slices of bread. Place these sandwiches\\nunder a broiler or in a very hot oven and toast them on both sides, or\\nomit the butter from the center, place the sandwiches in a slightly\\noiled frying pan, and brown them on both sides. In heating the\\nsandwiches, the cheese melts. Serve hot.\\n\\n53. CHEESE WAFERS.--If made daintily, cheese wafers may be served with\\nsalad or with tea for afternoon tea. The wafers selected for this\\npurpose should be small and the layer of cheese not very thick. If a\\nvery thin broth is served at the beginning of a meal, cheese wafers may\\naccompany it, but they should never be served with a heavy soup.\\n\\nCHEESE WAFERS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 doz. wafers\\nButter\\n3/4 grated cheese\\nPaprika\\n\\nSpread the wafers thinly with butter and sprinkle each with 1\\ntablespoonful of grated cheese and a pinch of paprika.

CHEESE STRAWS.--Nothing can be more delightful to serve with a\\nvegetable salad than cheese straws, which are illustrated in Fig. 8. An\\nattractive way to serve them is to slip them through small rings made\\nout of strips of the dough mixture and baked at the same time the straws\\nare baked and then place them at the side of the salad plate. They may\\naccompany a fruit salad, as well as a vegetable salad, but they are not\\nappropriate for serving with a meat or a fish salad.\\n\\nCHEESE STRAWS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 Tb. butter\\n2/3 c. flour\\n1 c. bread crumbs\\n1 c. grated or cut cheese\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\nPinch of Cayenne pepper\\n1/2 c. milk\\n\\nCream the butter and to it add the flour, bread crumbs, cheese, and\\nseasonings. Mix thoroughly and add the milk. Roll 1/4 inch thick and\\nthen cut 1/4 inch wide and 6 inches long. Bake until brown in a\\nmoderately hot oven.\\n\\n55. TOMATOES WITH CHEESE STUFFING.--The addition of cheese to the\\nstuffing used in stuffed tomatoes means added flavor, as well as\\nnutritive value in the form of protein, the food substance in which the\\ntomatoes themselves are lacking. The bread crumbs used for the stuffing\\nsupply a large amount of carbohydrate, so that the completed dish,\\nbesides being a very attractive one, contains all the food principles in\\nfairly large quantities. Stuffed tomatoes may be served as the main dish\\nin a light meal or as a vegetable dish in a heavy meal.\\n\\nTOMATOES WITH CHEESE STUFFING\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 tomatoes\\n1 c. bread crumbs\\n1 c. grated cheese\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/4 c. hot water\\n\\nSelect medium-sized tomatoes and hollow out the centers. Mix the crumbs,\\ncheese, salt, pepper, butter, and hot water with the pulp from the\\ncenters of the tomatoes. Fill the tomatoes with this stuffing, place in\\na pan, and bake in a moderate oven until the tomato can be pierced\\neasily with a fork. Serve hot.\\n\\n56. FIGS STUFFED WITH CHEESE.--As cheese is a very concentrated food, it\\nis often combined with another food to offset this effect. An excellent\\ncombination is formed by stuffing figs with cheese. Figs prepared in\\nthis way will be found to be very attractive and tasty and may be served\\nin the place of a dessert or a salad, depending on the kind and size of\\nthe meal with which they are used.\\n\\nFIGS STUFFED WITH CHEESE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1 pkg.

Steam the figs for 10 or 15\\nminutes or until they are soft; then cool them, cut out their stems,\\nfill their centers with the soft cheese, and serve.\\n\\n57. CHEESE SANDWICHES.--Very appetizing sandwiches that may be used to\\ntake the place of meat sandwiches or a protein dish at any time are made\\nwith a cheese filling. If these are made very small and dainty, they may\\nbe served with salad in a light meal. The addition of pickles, olives,\\nand pimiento, which are included in the accompanying recipe, makes the\\nfilling more attractive than the usual plain cheese by producing in it a\\nvariety of tastes. They also add bulk, which is lacking in both the\\nwhite bread and the cheese. If desired, graham or whole-wheat bread may\\nbe used in place of white bread.\\n\\nCHEESE SANDWICHES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1/4 lb. cheese\\n2 medium-sized pickles\\n1/2 pimiento\\nMeat from 1/2 doz. olives\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1/4 tsp. paprika\\nBread\\n\\nPut the cheese, pickles, pimiento, and olives through a food chopper,\\nand when chopped add the salt and the paprika. If the mixture is not\\nmoist enough to spread, add salad dressing or vinegar until it is of the\\nright consistency. Mix well and spread on thinly cut, buttered slices\\nof bread.\\n\\n\\nLUNCHEON MENU\\n\\n58. Many of the dishes for which recipes are given in this Section,\\nparticularly those including cheese as one of the ingredients, do very\\nwell for the main dish in a light meal, such as luncheon. In order that\\npractice may be had in preparing a well-balanced luncheon that includes\\na dish of this kind, a luncheon menu is here presented. The cheese\\nsouffl\\u00e9, which has been selected as the main dish in this menu, should\\nbe made according to the directions already given. Little difficulty\\nwill be experienced in making the other dishes, as recipes for them are\\ngiven immediately after the menu. All the recipes are intended for six\\npersons, so that if more or fewer are to be served, the recipes should\\nbe changed accordingly. This menu is presented with the intention that\\nit be tried by each student and a report of it then prepared according\\nto the plan outlined and sent with the work of the Examination\\nQuestions.\\n\\nMENU\\n\\nCream-of-Corn Soup\\nCheese Souffl\\u00e9\\nStewed Tomatoes\\nSaut\\u00e9d Potatoes\\nBrown Bread and Butter\\nBaked Apples\\nBlack Tea\\n\\n\\nRECIPES\\n\\nCREAM-OF-CORN SOUP\\n\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1 pt. milk\\n1 c. canned corn\\n1 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n\\nMake a white sauce of the flour, butter, and milk.

Eggs are of great importance in the diet, and to appreciate this fact\\nfully the true nature of this food must be understood. For domestic use,\\nthe eggs of guinea hens, turkeys, ducks, and geese occasionally find\\nfavor, but as eggs laid by hens are the kind that is commonly used, it\\nis to such eggs that this Section is devoted. A hen's egg may really be\\nconsidered as an undeveloped chicken, because it contains all the\\nelements required to build the body of the chick and provide it with the\\nenergy it needs to pick its way into the world. When it emerges from the\\nshell, it is fully developed, and in a short time it begins an\\nindependent existence, seeking and finding its own food. The fact that\\neggs store so much nutritive material explains to some extent why they\\nare a valuable source of food for man and why they are used so\\nextensively. However, as in the case of milk, the elements that eggs\\ncontain are not in just the right proportion for the sole nourishment of\\na human being, so they must generally be used in combination with\\nother foods.\\n\\n2. Most persons are familiar with the appearance of eggs, but in order\\nthat satisfactory results may be obtained in their selection, care, and\\ncooking, it will be necessary to look into the details of their\\ncomposition. As is well known, an egg consists of a porous shell lined\\nwith a fine, but tough, membrane that encloses the white and the yolk\\nand serves to protect them. The yolk is divided from the white by a\\ndelicate membrane, which permits it to be separated from the white when\\nan egg is carefully broken. This membrane extends to each end of the\\nshell in the form of a small cord, and it is so fastened to the shell as\\nto hold the yolk evenly suspended. The porous nature of an egg shell is\\nrequired to give air to the developing chick, but it is this\\ncharacteristic that permits eggs to spoil as they grow old and are\\nexposed to air, for through these minute pores, or openings, the water\\nin the egg evaporates and air and bacteria enter. Of course, as the\\nwater evaporates and is replaced by air, the egg becomes lighter.\\nBecause of this fact, the freshness of eggs can be determined by placing\\nthem in water. When they are fresh, they will sink in cold water, but as\\nthey decompose they become lighter and will float.\\n\\nSince it is known that the spoiling of eggs is due to the entrance of\\nair through the porous shell, it may be inferred that their decay may be\\nprevented either by protecting the shell so that air cannot enter or by\\nkeeping the eggs at so low a temperature that bacteria cannot grow.\\nAlthough stored eggs always deteriorate more or less, both of these\\nmethods of preservation have proved very satisfactory, the former being\\nused largely in the home and the latter finding its solution in cold\\nstorage. A knowledge of how eggs can be preserved, however, is of great\\nvalue, for if there were no means of preservation and eventual\\nmarketing, the price of eggs would at times rise to actual\\nprohibitive limits.\\n\\n3. That eggs as an article of food are growing in importance is\\nindicated by the fact that their production has come to be a large and\\nwidely distributed industry. Owing to the private consumption and sale\\nof eggs, an accurate statement of the number of eggs produced is\\ndifficult to give. Still, in a report, the United States Bureau of\\nAgriculture estimated the value of the yearly egg production at\\nsomething more than three million dollars, with an allowance of about\\n210 eggs, or 17-1/2 dozen, per capita each year, or 4 eggs a week for\\neach person. These figures, however, are only suggestive of the\\nproduction, use, and value of eggs, for as the population increases so\\ndoes the use of eggs. In fact, they are proving to be almost\\nindispensable to the cook, the baker, the manufacturers of certain\\nfoods, and many others.\\n\\n4. With the increase in the demand for eggs has come a corresponding\\nsteady advance in the money value of this product and, consequently, an\\nincrease in its price. The housewife who would practice economy in\\ncookery can readily see, therefore, that with reference to the number of\\neggs required and the ways in which they are used, she must choose\\ncarefully the recipes and methods she employs. If the eggs are always\\nconsidered a part of a meal, their use is seldom an extravagance, even\\nat such high prices as they sometimes attain. On the other hand, if a\\ndessert that requires the use of many eggs is added to a meal that is\\nitself sufficient in food value, it is not unreasonable to regard such\\nuse of eggs as an extravagance. A point that should be taken into\\nconsideration in the use of eggs in the diet, especially when their\\nprice seems very high, is that there is no waste matter in them, unless\\nthe shell is regarded as waste. Therefore, they are often more\\neconomical than other foods that can be bought for less money.\\n\\nIt must not be understood, however, that eggs are used only as an\\narticle of diet. They are also a very important food ingredient, being\\nemployed in the preparation of many kinds of dishes. For instance, they\\nare often used to thicken custards, sauces, etc.; to clarify soups and\\njellies; to lighten cakes, puddings, hot breads, and other baked\\nmixtures; to form the basis for salad dressings; and to combine or hold\\ntogether many varieties of food.\\n\\n\\nNUTRITIVE VALUE OF EGGS\\n\\n5. Like milk, eggs are often spoken of as a perfect food. Still, as has\\nbeen pointed out, they are not a perfect food for man, but they are of\\nespecial nutritive value and should be used freely in the diet just as\\nlong as their cost neither limits nor prohibits their use. An idea of\\nhow they compare with other nutritious foods can be obtained from Fig.\\n1, which shows that eight eggs are equal in food value to 1 quart of\\nmilk or 1 pound and 5 ounces of beefsteak. A better understanding of\\ntheir food value, however, can be gained from a study of their\\ncomposition.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\\n\\n6. Since an egg is an undeveloped chick that requires only the addition\\nof warmth to develop it into a living, moving creature made of muscles,\\nbones, and blood, it is evident that this food contains considerable\\ntissue-building and energy-producing material. The exact proportion of\\nthis material, as well as the other substances found in eggs, is given\\nin the food chart shown in _Essentials of Cookery_, Part 1. The chart\\nrelating to the composition of eggs points out that the edible portion\\nof the whole egg consists of 73.7 per cent. of water, 14.8 per cent. of\\nprotein, 10.5 per cent. of fat, and about 1 per cent. of ash, or mineral\\nmatter. The protein, which is chiefly in the form of albumen, and the\\nfat are the most digestible of these elements, while the mineral\\nconstituents are as valuable for the growing child as for the chick.\\nWhen the total weight of an egg is taken into consideration, the shell\\nconstitutes about 11 per cent., the yolk 32 per cent., and the white 57\\nper cent. The composition of the yolk and the white differs somewhat,\\nthe yolk having the greater food value, a fact that is also clearly\\nindicated in the chart. The white contains a larger proportion of water\\nthan the yolk, but the yolk contains the most of the fat and more\\nprotein and mineral matter, or ash, than the white. In addition, the\\nchart shows that the number of calories to the pound of whole egg is\\n700, of egg yolk is 1,608, and of egg white is 265.\\n\\n7. PROTEIN IN EGGS.--The nature of the food substances in eggs is of\\nnearly as great importance as their amount, for they not only determine\\nthe value of this food in the body, but influence its cooking. That\\nprotein is present in both the yolk and the white is apparent from the\\nfact that they coagulate when heat is applied. Because eggs are high in\\nprotein, containing 14.8 per cent. of this substance, they may be\\nregarded as equivalent to a meat dish, and it is only when they are\\nextremely high in price that they cannot be frequently substituted for\\nmeat to advantage. They are often used to take the place of milk, too,\\nfor eggs and milk are more alike in nutritive value than any other two\\nprotein foods; but, of the two, milk yields the cheaper form of protein.\\nLike meat and milk, eggs are rich in all those food materials which\\nenter into the construction of bone, muscle, and blood.\\n\\n8. FAT IN EGGS.--A study of the food chart previously mentioned will\\nshow that eggs contain proportionately almost as much fat as protein and\\nthat nearly all this fat is found in the yolk. Since fat produces more\\nheat or energy, weight for weight, than any other food substance, and\\nsince eggs contain neither starch nor sugar, it is evident that the fat\\nof this food is the main source of the energy-producing material. Fat in\\neggs occurs in the form of an emulsion, or tiny particles, and, like the\\nfat of milk, is very readily digested. It is for this reason that both\\nof these foods are particularly well adapted to the diet of both\\nchildren and adults. The presence of quantities of protein and fat and\\nthe absence of carbohydrate in eggs indicate that the proper thing to\\ncombine with this food, in order to have a well-balanced meal when eggs\\nare eaten, is carbohydrate in some form.\\n\\n9. MINERALS IN EGGS.--Eggs are especially valuable for the mineral salts\\nthey contain, chief among which are lime, phosphorus, sulphur, iron,\\npotassium, and sodium. For this reason, the addition of eggs to any kind\\nof diet supplies a large amount of the minerals that are needed for\\nbone, blood, and tissue building. A favorable point concerning the\\nminerals found in eggs is that they are not affected to any extent by\\ncooking. Therefore, in the preparation of any dish, if eggs are added to\\nother foods, that dish will contain an additional amount of mineral\\nsalts, plus the nutritive value of the eggs.\\n\\n10. DIGESTIBILITY OF EGGS.--In connection with the discussion of the\\nfood substances of which eggs are composed, it will be well to note how\\nthese affect the digestibility of this food. But just what is meant by\\nthis characteristic with reference to eggs must first be understood. In\\nsome foods, digestibility may mean the length of time required for them\\nto digest; in others, the completeness of the digestion; and in still\\nothers, the ease and comfort with which the process of digestion\\nproceeds. In the case of eggs, digestibility refers to the quantity of\\nthis food that is absorbed, that is, actually dissolved and permitted to\\nenter the blood stream. The nutritive value of eggs is not so high as\\nwould naturally be supposed, for, although the protein, fat, and mineral\\nsalts of an egg make up about one-fourth of its contents, one egg equals\\nin nutritive value only 1/2 cupful of milk, a small potato, or a\\nmedium-sized apple. However, when the proportion of the nutritive\\nmaterial that the body retains from this food, or its digestibility, is\\nconsidered, eggs rank extremely high, it having been determined by\\nexperiments that 97 per cent. of the protein and 95 per cent. of the fat\\nare assimilated. A point worthy of note in this connection, though, is\\nthat eggs contain no cellulose, such as that found in grains,\\nvegetables, and fruits. Therefore, in order to add the much-needed bulk\\nto the diet, foods that do contain cellulose should be served with eggs.\\n\\n11. Whether or not the cooking of eggs has any effect on their\\ndigestibility is a matter that has also been investigated. The results\\nof the experiments made indicate that cooking makes some difference with\\nthe rate of digestion, but very little with its thoroughness. So far as\\nthe rapidity of digestion is concerned, there is very little difference\\nbetween raw eggs and slightly cooked eggs; but hard-cooked eggs,\\nalthough they may be digested as completely as soft-cooked ones, require\\nlonger time for the accomplishment of the process. This is due to the\\nfact that the whites of hard-cooked eggs are so firm in texture that,\\nunless they are finely chopped or thoroughly masticated, the digestive\\njuices are not able to act on them quickly. As a result, portions of\\nthem may escape digestion or remain in the digestive tract for some time\\nand decompose. For this reason, hard-cooked eggs are usually excluded\\nfrom the diet of children and invalids, and even healthy adults should\\nbe careful to masticate them thoroughly.\\n\\n\\nSELECTION OF EGGS\\n\\n12. On first thought it would seem as if there is very little to guide\\nthe housewife in the selection of eggs, it being extremely difficult to\\ntell from their external appearance whether or not they are fresh or\\nstale. As a rule, she must trust largely to the honesty of the person\\nfrom whom she buys eggs. Still she need not depend entirely on the\\ndealer's word, for, at least to a certain extent, there are ways in\\nwhich she may judge the quality of eggs. Because of the great value of\\neggs as a food and for cooking purposes, it is important that the\\nhousewife make use of all available information on this matter and, in\\naddition, become familiar with the trade practices in the egg industry.\\n\\n13. MARKETING OF EGGS.--As is generally known, hens lay a large number\\nof eggs in the spring of the year, but they do not lay readily in the\\ncold winter months; and not alone are the greatest quantities of eggs\\nproduced in April and May, but those laid at this time are of the best\\nquality. Because of this condition and in order that the demand during\\nthe time of scarcity may be supplied, it is necessary that a\\nconsiderable number of eggs be preserved when they are comparatively\\ncheap and abundant. Also, in the preserving of eggs for future use, it\\nis of the greatest importance that they be kept in the best possible\\ncondition and manner, so that when they are used, months after they are\\nlaid, they may be as good as it is possible to have them.\\n\\nThe advance made in storage and transportation methods in recent years\\nhas done much toward making the egg supply uniform all the year around.\\nNot long ago, because of inadequate means of storage and shipping, eggs\\nwere sold only a short distance from the place where they were produced.\\nHowever, with the coming of cold storage and improved methods of\\nshipping, eggs have been changed from a perishable and more or less\\nseasonable food to a staple one. Now it is possible to collect them in\\nlarge quantities, to keep them for a considerable time before selling\\nthem, and to ship them long distances. To safeguard the public, though,\\nauthorities have set a time limit for the storage of eggs, the legal\\ntime they may be kept being 8 months. By this is meant that eggs placed\\nin the warehouse in May must be released or sold in December; whereas,\\nthose stored in June must be released no later than January.\\n\\n14. Eggs that have been kept too long in storage are characterized by a\\nmusty odor and flavor, the breaking of the yolk and its mixing with the\\nwhite, and a watery condition of the white. Such eggs, of course, cannot\\nbe sold legally. Those which may be placed on the market are graded\\naccording to their freshness, cleanliness, size, cracks, and color. With\\nthe exception of their freshness, these points can be readily told from\\nthe appearance of the eggs; but, in order to determine whether an egg is\\nfresh or not, it is generally put through a process known as _candling_,\\nby which the interior condition of the egg can be ascertained.\\n\\nIn the grading of eggs, all those of the best size, color, and condition\\nare sold under a particular trade name and bring a high or a low price,\\naccording to the grading. Others that are not so perfect are put in\\nanother grade and sell for prices that vary according to the demand.\\nEggs, of course, differ in appearance and in many cases they are sorted\\nin order to satisfy the demand. For instance, in some localities, eggs\\nhaving a brown shell sell for the highest price, while in other places,\\neggs having a white shell are in the greatest demand and bring the\\nhighest price. Unsorted eggs are not held in much favor and do not\\nbring so good a price as those which are all one color. Many persons\\nhave an idea that the color of the shell of an egg bears some relation\\nto its nutritive value and flavor. However, authorities on foods agree\\nthat, other things being alike, the edible portion of white-shelled eggs\\nhas essentially the same composition and nutritive value as that of\\ndark-shelled eggs.\\n\\n15. QUALITY OF EGGS.--The natural quality of eggs depends largely on the\\nfood of the hens and their conditions of living. Because of this fact,\\nthe selection, breeding, and care of fowls have developed into a\\nscience, particularly since the production of eggs has grown into an\\nindustry. When the quality itself is to be determined, all the\\ncharacteristics of eggs must be taken into consideration; still there is\\none particular point on which the quality of eggs depends, and that is\\ntheir freshness. Various agencies, however, are constantly at work to\\nrender this quality inferior. Chief among these are the molds and\\nbacteria that pass through the porous shells of eggs that have been\\nimproperly cared for or have become contaminated by being allowed to\\nremain in unclean surroundings. Such bacteria are responsible for the\\nunpleasant flavors that are found in bad eggs. Because of their harmful\\neffect, every effort should be made to prevent the entrance of the germs\\nthat cause decay, and, as has been stated, the best way in which to\\naccomplish this is to protect the shell. If it is found that bacteria\\nhave entered, the eggs will become unfit for use quickly unless their\\ngrowth is prevented. This may be done by storing the eggs at a\\ntemperature that will keep the bacteria dormant, or inert.\\n\\n16. If the eggs are kept under the proper conditions, they will not\\nactually spoil for a long time; but it is seldom that they are not more\\nor less affected by storage of any kind that covers a period of several\\nmonths. One change that can always be looked for in such eggs is in the\\nair space at the broad end. When an egg is first laid, this air space is\\nsmall, but since the water contained in the egg slowly evaporates\\nthrough the porous shell it increases in size as the egg grows staler.\\nFor this reason, the freshness of an egg can often be determined by the\\nsize of this air space.\\n\\nIn addition, the purposes for which eggs are used are somewhat affected\\nby their storage. A stale egg, although it may not be actually spoiled\\nto the extent that it cannot be used as food, will not produce such good\\nresults in a cooking process as a fresh egg, especially if it is used\\nfor leavening. In fact, it is impossible to produce the desired results\\nwith eggs that have undergone a certain amount of change, even though\\ntheir odor and their flavor do not indicate that they are spoiled.\\n\\n17. JUDGING THE QUALITY OF EGGS IN THE MARKET.--While, as has been\\nmentioned, the housewife must depend considerably on the dealer's word\\nas to the freshness of the eggs she purchases, it will be well for her\\nto be familiar with the trade names of eggs and their meaning. The names\\nused differ, of course, in various localities, but all large\\ndistributors grade and name eggs in much the same way. In deciding on\\nthe grade to which eggs belong, a certain number of points are given for\\ncolor, size, freshness, and appearance, and the sum total of these\\npoints determines the grade, a special name being given for each grade.\\nFor instance, eggs that can be graded 90 are called _extra fancy_; those\\nwhich receive a grade of 80, _fancy_; those which are graded 70,\\n_strictly fresh_; and those which can be graded only 60, _cooking eggs_.\\nWhen eggs are put on the market under such names, it can be expected\\nthat the quality will correspond to the grade and the price will vary\\nwith the grade. Therefore, the trade name and the price are two of the\\nprincipal ways in which the quality of eggs in the market may be judged.\\n\\n18. Another way of judging the quality of eggs consists in observing the\\ncondition of the surface of the shell. When eggs are freshly laid, the\\nshell is covered with a substance, called _bloom_, that gives it a\\nfeeling much like that of a thin lime coating deposited in a pan after\\nwater boils. This coating disappears gradually as the egg is exposed to\\nthe air, but as long as it remains, the egg may be considered as fresh\\nand germ-proof. While this way of determining freshness is probably the\\nquickest, it is possible that the quality of some eggs from which the\\nbloom has recently disappeared has not been injured.\\n\\n19. When eggs are selected in the market, certain points in their\\nappearance should also be noted. If eggs of the best quality are\\ndesired, medium-sized ones that are uniform in size and color should be\\nselected. With regard to shape, they should have a comparatively long\\noval shell, one end of which is blunt and the other, a sharp curve.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2: Internal structure of egg.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3: FRESH, 3 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS, OLDER.]\\n\\n20. JUDGING THE QUALITY OF EGGS IN THE HOME.--After eggs have been\\nreceived in the home, several simple tests for determining their\\nfreshness can be applied in addition to the ones already mentioned. A\\nrather indefinite test, but one that is sometimes applied to determine\\nthe freshness of an egg, is to shake it. However, to be able to carry\\nout this test successfully, it is well to understand the interior\\nstructure of an egg. Fig. 2 illustrates this clearly. At _a_ is shown\\nthe air space previously mentioned; at _b_, the spiral cords that run\\nfrom the yolk to each end of the egg and hold the yolk in place; at _c_,\\nthe yolk; and at _d_, the white. When the water inside the shell\\nevaporates, the yolk and white shrink so much that they can be felt\\nmoving from side to side when the egg is shaken. The staler the egg, the\\nmore pronounced does the movement become. This method should be applied\\nonly immediately before the egg is to be used, as the thin membrane\\nbetween the yolk and the white and the spiral cords that hold up the\\nyolk are liable to be disturbed by the shaking. If they are broken, the\\nyolk will settle and finally adhere to the shell in case the egg is\\nstored for any length of time after that.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4: Testing the egg.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5: four eggs.]\\n\\n21. If nothing has been done to preserve eggs, the simple test for\\nfreshness illustrated in Fig. 3, which consists in placing the eggs in a\\nglass containing water, will be found effective. A perfectly fresh egg\\nwill sink when it is put into the water, but if the egg is 3 weeks old\\nthe broad end will rise slightly from the bottom of the glass. An egg\\nthat is 3 months old will sink into water until only a slight portion of\\nthe shell remains exposed; whereas, if the egg is older or stale, it\\nwill rise in the water until nearly half of it is exposed.  22. The\\ntest known as candling, which is usually applied to eggs before they are\\nput on the market, can also be practiced by the housewife in the home.\\nThis method of determining the freshness of eggs consists in placing a\\npiece of cardboard containing a hole a little smaller than an egg\\nbetween the eye and a light, which may be from a lamp, a gas jet, or an\\nelectric light, and holding the egg in front of the light in the manner\\nshown in Fig. 4. The rays of light passing through the egg show the\\ncondition of the egg, the size of its air space, and the growth of mold\\nor the spoiling of the egg by any ordinary means.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6 (_a_) (_b_)]\\n\\nIn Fig. 5 is shown how an egg at various stages of freshness appears\\nwhen candled. When an egg is fresh, it will appear as in (_a_); that is,\\nthe yolk will be barely distinguishable from the white except as a\\nslightly darker area in the center of the egg, and the entire egg will\\nappear clear and bright and free from spots. In an egg that is a little\\nolder, candling will reveal a slightly darker yolk, a cloudy white, and\\na larger air space, as in (_b_). In a watery egg, or one that is\\nbeginning to spoil, various dark spots and blotches usually develop, as\\nview (_c_) indicates. When an egg is rotten, the contents of the shell\\nwill look dark in candling and the yolk will appear to be mixed with the\\nwhite, as in (_d_).  23. If the housewife does not wish to resort to\\ncandling, she may determine the condition of an egg by breaking it into\\na saucer and examining it carefully. If the egg is newly laid, no odor\\nwill be detected and the white will be clear, elastic, and rather thick;\\nalso, where it joins the yolk it will be almost solid. The yolk of such\\nan egg will have an even yellow color, without lighter or darker spots\\nand, as shown in Fig. 6 (_a_), will stand up well from the surface of\\nthe white. Sometimes a small spot of blood may be detected on the yolk\\nof a perfectly fresh egg, but, while this is not pleasant to look at, it\\ndoes not affect the quality of the egg. When an egg that is not real\\nfresh is broken into a saucer, the yolk will lie flat, as in (_b_). In\\nan egg that is quite stale, the membrane surrounding the yolk is easily\\ndestroyed, so that even when such an egg is broken carefully the yolk\\nand the white are likely to run together.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPRESERVATION OF EGGS\\n\\nCAUSES AND PREVENTION OF DETERIORATION\\n\\n24. As has been implied in the discussion given thus far, eggs will\\ndeteriorate or spoil in a comparatively short time unless something is\\ndone to preserve them. In view of the eggs she keeps on hand at home, as\\nwell as those she buys, the causes of spoiling and the ways in which to\\nprevent spoiling are matters with which the housewife should be\\nfamiliar, particularly if she would secure for her family eggs of the\\nbest quality at prices that are not beyond her means. The spoiling of\\neggs is due to decomposition, which is caused by molds or bacteria that\\nresult from accidental causes, and, in fertile eggs, to the germination\\nand development of the chick, which is a natural process. The loss of\\nquality resulting from molds and bacteria in the egg is brought about by\\ntheir growth and by the formation of chemical compounds, which give\\nspoiled eggs their peculiar appearance, taste, and odor. Some of these\\nmolds are not injurious to health, while others may give rise to more or\\nless serious illness.\\n\\n25. Various methods have been devised whereby their rapid deterioration\\nmay be prevented, and a knowledge of these is important to those who\\nhave occasion to purchase eggs or to keep them over from the season of\\nplenty to the season of scarcity. The method followed to prevent losses\\ndue to the development of the embryo consists in the production of\\ninfertile eggs--that is, eggs that are non-productive. This is a point\\nthat is as well worth remembering in the home production of eggs as it\\nis in professional poultry raising. The method employed to prevent the\\ninfection of eggs by molds and bacteria is to keep them clean and dry\\nfrom the time they are laid until they are finally used.\\n\\n26. While the preservation of eggs is carried on to a greater extent at\\npresent than formerly, the idea is neither new nor original; indeed, it\\nhas been practiced for many years by the people of some foreign\\ncountries. For instance, in some sections of China, duck eggs are\\npreserved by covering them with a layer of mud, and such eggs are often\\nkept for a year or more before they are eaten. However, eggs stored in\\nthis way decompose and their odor and flavor disappear before they are\\nused, so that they must usually be hard boiled before they can be eaten.\\nEgg preservation such as is practiced in the United States is the\\nopposite of this and attempts to prevent not only ripening processes and\\nputrefactive changes but any bacterial or other changes that lessen the\\noriginal quality. It will be well to note, however, that eggs preserved\\nfor any length of time deteriorate to some extent and cannot be expected\\nto be equally as good as fresh eggs.\\n\\n\\nCOMMERCIAL PRESERVATION OF EGGS\\n\\n27. The usual market method of preserving eggs is by cold storage, an\\nindustry that has developed to vast proportions in recent years. The\\nsuccess of this method depends on the fact that germs causing\\ndecomposition will not live in a low temperature. While the plan of\\nstoring eggs is responsible for their high price at certain times, it is\\nalso a means of supplying eggs to many persons who would otherwise not\\nbe able to obtain them. The greatest point in favor of this plan,\\nhowever, is that it makes possible the marketing of quantities of eggs\\nduring the winter season of scarcity at a price that, although somewhat\\nhigh at times, is much more moderate than it would be if it were not\\npossible to store eggs in large quantities.\\n\\n28. In order that advantage may be taken of favorable climatic\\nconditions, eggs are commonly purchased for storage as early in the year\\nas they are abundant. They are selected with great care, only those\\nwhich are clean, sound, and fresh being used. These eggs are packed in\\nclean cases, and then placed in warehouses where they are kept at a\\ntemperature just above freezing, or one that ranges from 32 to 40\\ndegrees Fahrenheit. In such storage, precaution is usually taken to\\nprevent the eggs from freezing, for while freezing does not necessarily\\ninjure them for immediate use it breaks the shell because of the\\ncontraction that occurs. While the eggs are in storage, they are also\\nprotected as far as possible from air circulation, as this increases\\nevaporation and causes the contents of eggs to shrink. To prevent the\\nyolks from settling to one side, and finally adhering to the shell, the\\neggs are turned frequently. The usual limits of storage are from 6 to 9\\nmonths, but eggs are not generally allowed to remain in storage more\\nthan 8 months. When taken out at the end of that time, it will be found\\nthat they have deteriorated very little, and while they cannot compete\\nwith the better grades of fresh eggs, they are as desirable as most of\\nthe eggs that can be purchased in the early fall when eggs are not\\nplentiful.\\n\\n29. Sometimes eggs are removed from the shells, stored for commercial\\nuse in containers of about 50 pounds each, and kept at the freezing\\npoint until they are to be used. Eggs in this form, which may be bought\\nwith the yolks and whites either mixed or separate, find a ready market\\nin bakeries and restaurants, where large quantities of eggs are\\ncontinually used. Such eggs remain good for any length of time while\\nthey are kept frozen, but they must be used immediately after they are\\nremoved from storage.\\n\\n30. It is not always necessary to keep eggs at a cold temperature in\\norder to preserve them, for a method that has proved very satisfactory\\nis to reduce them to the form of powder by drying them. In this form,\\nthe bulk is greatly reduced, 1 pound of the dry material representing 30\\nto 40 eggs, and in order to prepare them for use in cooking they must be\\nmixed with water. POWDERED EGGS, or _desiccated eggs_, as they are\\nusually called, can be kept for an indefinite length of time without\\nspecial care in storage, when they are wholesome and carefully handled.\\nTests that have been made show that eggs of this kind give fairly good\\nresults when used in cookery, but they are used principally by bakers,\\nfor they can be obtained more cheaply than fresh eggs, especially when\\nit is difficult to secure eggs in other forms.\\n\\n HOME PRESERVATION OF EGGS\\n\\n31. The housewife who desires to run her household on an economical\\nbasis will not depend entirely on eggs that are commercially stored, but\\nwill take advantage of one of the many methods by which eggs may be\\nsuccessfully kept in the home. By being prudent in this matter, she will\\nbe prepared to supply her family with this commodity at times when the\\nmarket price is high.\\n\\nAs many as twenty household methods have been tried out for the\\npreserving of eggs, but each one is based on the theory that decay is\\nhindered when the shell is covered with some substance that renders it\\nair-tight and prevents evaporation or the entrance of bacteria and mold.\\nAmong the methods that have met with the most success are burying eggs\\nin oats, bran, or salt; rubbing them with fat; dipping them in melted\\nparaffin; covering them with varnish or shellac; and putting them down\\nin lime water or in a solution of water glass.\\n\\nNo matter which of these methods is adopted, however, it will be well to\\nnote that only eggs laid in April, May, or June should be used for\\nstorage purposes, as these are the best ones laid during the year; also,\\nthat the eggs should always be packed with the small end down, because\\nthe yolk will not settle toward the small end so readily as toward the\\nlarge end or the side.\\n\\n32. Of these various ways of preserving eggs in the home, probably the\\noldest method is that of packing the eggs in oats, bran, or salt. This\\nmethod is fairly effective, but the eggs preserved by it do not keep so\\nlong as eggs preserved by other methods, nor is their quality so good.\\nPreserving eggs by completely covering the shells with fat, vaseline,\\nparaffin, varnish, or other substance that will exclude the air but not\\nimpart flavor to the eggs, proves a more satisfactory method so far as\\nthe eggs are concerned, but it requires more time and handling. To\\nassist in their preservation, eggs are sometimes immersed in boiling\\nwater for 12 to 15 seconds. This process, which causes the white to\\nharden slightly just inside of the shell, keeps the eggs fairly well,\\nbut it is rather difficult to accomplish, as the least overcooking\\nrenders the egg unfit for use as a raw egg.\\n\\nAs a result of many trials, it has been found that putting eggs down in\\nthe various solutions that are used for this purpose is the most\\neffective way of preserving them under home conditions, provided, of\\ncourse, the solutions in which the eggs are immersed do not flavor the\\neggs. Therefore, to assist the housewife, detailed directions for using\\nlime water and water glass for this purpose are here given.\\n\\n33. PRESERVATION WITH LIMEWATER.--To prepare limewater for the\\npreservation of eggs, dissolve 1 pound or 1 pint of salt and 1 quart of\\nfinely slaked lime in 3 gallons of water, stir the solution at frequent\\nintervals for a day or two, and then allow the liquid to settle. Place\\nthe eggs in tall stone crocks or kegs with their pointed ends turned\\ndown, filling the receptacles to within a few inches of the top. Pour\\nthe clear limewater over the eggs so arranged, allowing it to rise an\\ninch or two above the top layer. Then stand the vessel in a cool place\\nwhere the temperature will not exceed 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Eggs so\\ntreated will keep for at least 6 or 8 months. The only objection to this\\nplan is that the eggs preserved by it sometimes acquire a slight\\nlime taste.\\n\\n34. PRESERVATION WITH WATER GLASS.--Putting eggs down in a solution of\\nwater glass is without doubt the most satisfactory method of storing\\nthem in the home. So effective does this method prove that the housewife\\nwho has a convenient and proper storage room should not fail to take\\nadvantage of this way of laying up a supply of eggs.\\n\\nThe commercial form of water glass is usually a mixture of potassium and\\nsodium silicate, which, besides being cheaper than that which is\\nchemically pure, is the kind that is preferred for the purpose of\\npreserving eggs. A good quality of it either in a sirup-like solution or\\nin the form of a powder retails in drug or grocery stores for about 10\\ncents a pound. To make a solution of the desired strength to preserve\\neggs satisfactorily, dissolve 1 part of water glass in 7 parts of warm\\nwater that has first been boiled to drive off bacteria, mold, spores,\\netc. One quart of water glass will make sufficient solution to cover\\nabout 12 dozen eggs. With the solution thoroughly mixed, it is ready to\\npour over the eggs.\\n\\nIn selecting eggs for the purpose of storing, be careful to choose only\\nthose which are clean, fresh, and perfectly sound, and, if possible,\\ninfertile. It is advisable not to wash them before they are put into the\\npreservative, for they will keep better if their bloom is not removed.\\nPlace the eggs in receptacles in the manner explained for preserving\\neggs in limewater, and over them pour the water-glass solution until\\nthey are all covered. If the eggs so prepared are stored in a cool\\nplace, they will keep as long as those preserved in limewater; besides,\\nthere will be no danger of their acquiring any foreign flavor.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nCOOKING OF EGGS\\n\\nPRELIMINARY PREPARATION\\n\\n35. The successful preparation of eggs for their use as a food demands\\nthat certain points must be observed by the housewife. For instance, she\\nmust see that the eggs she uses are in the right condition; that the\\nshells are properly broken for the most convenient removal of the egg;\\nthat the parts of the egg are separated in the right way in case the\\nwhites and the yolks are to be used separately; and that the eggs\\nreceive the right treatment for the purpose for which they are to be\\nused. Attention to all these points not only will insure the most\\nsatisfactory results, but will enable the housewife to supply her family\\nwith food that is extremely wholesome and nutritious.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\\n\\n36. Exterior Condition of Eggs.--As has been explained, clean eggs are\\nthe most desirable, but it is not advisable to wash eggs that are to be\\nkept for even a short time, as washing them removes the natural coating\\nthat helps to prevent the entrance of bacteria. However, as it is\\nnecessary that the shells be perfectly clean before they are broken or\\nbefore the eggs are cooked, the eggs may be washed or wiped with a damp\\ncloth immediately before such processes.\\n\\n37. BREAKING OF EGGS.--In cookery, it is usually desirable to break an\\negg shell so that the yolk will not run into the white; that is, so\\nthat these can be kept separate. While there are several methods of\\ndoing this, the housewife should adopt the one that is most convenient\\nfor her. A quick method that is often employed consists in striking the\\nshell on the edge of the pan or the bowl into which the contents are to\\nbe put. A preferable method, however, is illustrated in Fig. 7. It\\nconsists in striking one side of the shell, midway between the ends, a\\nsharp blow with the edge of a knife. The advantage of this method will\\nbe evident after a trial or two, for it will be found that the depth of\\nthe cut made by the knife can be so gauged that there will be little\\ndanger of breaking the yolk. Besides, fragments of the shell are not\\nlikely to fall into the bowl or the pan with the contents of the egg.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8]\\n\\n38. SEPARATING OF EGGS.--Frequently recipes require that the yolks and\\nwhites of eggs be beaten separately before being added to the other\\ningredients. When this is the case, care must be exercised in taking the\\negg from the shell. The method by which this is most easily accomplished\\nis illustrated in Fig. 8. As will be observed, the shell is first broken\\nas nearly as possible into halves and then, while the egg is poured from\\n1/2 of the shell into the other, the white is dropped into a dish and\\nthe yolk is retained in the shell. During this process, the yolk should\\nremain intact in its delicate membrane, for if it becomes mixed with the\\nwhite the lightness of the white will be injured. To separate the yolk\\nfrom the white is not difficult when eggs are fresh, but as they become\\nstale the membrane surrounding the yolk grows weak and breaks easily. If\\nthe yolk breaks and any of it falls into the white, it must be\\ncompletely removed before the white is beaten.\\n\\n39. BEATING OF EGGS.--Sometimes eggs are cooked in the shell and other\\ntimes they are used alone just as they are removed from the shell, as in\\nthe frying and poaching processes; however, when they are to be\\ncombined with other ingredients, they are usually beaten. Eggs are\\nbeaten for the purpose of mixing the yolk and the white or of\\nincorporating air to act as a leavening agent when the eggs are heated\\nin the cooking process. Various utensils, such as a fork, an egg whip,\\nor an egg beater, may be employed for beating eggs, the one to select\\ndepending on the use to which the eggs are to be put. The rotary, or\\nDover, egg beater, previously described as a labor-saving device and\\nillustrated in Fig. 9 (_a_), should be used to beat either whole eggs or\\nthe yolks of eggs when they are to be used in custards, mayonnaise,\\ncakes, puddings, etc., as it will beat them sufficiently light for such\\npurposes. However, for the beating of egg whites, use should be made of\\na fork or of an egg whip similar to that shown in (_b_), because the\\nwhites must be lifted instead of stirred for the incorporation of air,\\nand it is only with a utensil of this kind that this can be\\naccomplished. Then, too, more air can be incorporated into the whites\\nand the volume of the egg thereby increased by means of a fork or an egg\\nwhip than by an egg beater. An important point to remember in this\\nconnection is that eggs can be beaten more successfully when they are\\ncold and have had a pinch of salt added to them.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10]\\n\\n40. In the beating of eggs, it should be remembered that for some\\npurposes, as in making some kinds of sponge cake, they are beaten until\\nnearly frothy, as shown in Fig. 10, when they do not stand up nor cling\\nto the whip; whereas, for other purposes, as in making meringue, they\\nare beaten until they are stiff enough to stand up well and to adhere to\\nthe whip, as Fig. 11 shows. When egg whites are to be beaten stiff, care\\nshould be taken not to continue the beating too long. If this is done,\\nthey will become dry and will break up into small pieces, a condition\\nthat will mean a loss of some of the air that has been incorporated. It\\nis well also to observe that egg whites should always be beaten in the\\nsame direction and that the same motion should be continued throughout\\nthe beating, for a change of direction or motion always causes a loss of\\nair. A final precaution to take is never to allow egg whites to stand\\nafter they are beaten. If this is done, the leavening power of the eggs\\nis reduced, because the air soon escapes from beaten eggs and leaves\\nunderneath them a clear liquid that can never be beaten up. For\\ninstance, eggs that are to be used for boiled icing should not be beaten\\nuntil the sirup has finished boiling. However, eggs that have been\\nseparated but not beaten may stand for a couple of hours, provided they\\nare covered and kept in a cool place.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11]\\n\\n\\nPOINTS TO OBSERVE IN COOKING EGGS\\n\\n41. As has been previously stated, the substance in eggs that requires\\nspecial care in the cooking process is the protein, which occurs in this\\nfood in the form of albumen. Because of this, certain points concerning\\nthe treatment that the albumen requires should be kept in mind. In a raw\\negg, the albumen occurs in a semiliquid form, but it coagulates at a\\nlower temperature than does the yolk, which contains a high percentage\\nof fat. After coagulation, the consistency of the two parts is very\\ndifferent. The white is elastic and more or less tough, while the yolk,\\nupon being thoroughly cooked, becomes powdery, or mealy, and breaks up\\ninto minute particles. The egg white begins to coagulate at 134 degrees\\nFahrenheit, and it becomes white and jellylike at 160 degrees. Bringing\\nan egg to such a temperature produces a more desirable result than\\ncooking it at a high temperature--boiling point, for instance--because\\nthe albumen, instead of becoming tough, as it does at a high\\ntemperature, acquires a soft, tender consistency that exists throughout\\nthe entire egg. An egg cooked in this way is more digestible and\\nappetizing than one that is boiled until it becomes hard and tough.\\n\\n42. The low temperature at which eggs will cook in the shell applies\\nalso to eggs when they are combined with other foods. Sometimes,\\nhowever, a mixture in which eggs are one of the ingredients must be\\ncooked at a high temperature because the materials mixed with them\\nrequire it. This difficulty can be overcome when eggs are combined with\\nstarchy foods, such as corn starch, rice, and tapioca, that require long\\ncooking. In such a case, all the ingredients except the eggs may be\\ncooked the length of time they require, after which the eggs may be\\nadded so that they will cook just long enough to become coagulated.\\nLonger cooking is liable to spoil the texture. Often the starchy mixture\\nretains sufficient heat to set the eggs without further cooking after\\nthey are added.\\n\\n43. A very nutritious way in which to prepare eggs when they are to be\\nused for a dessert is to combine them with milk to form a custard,\\nwhich, after being sweetened and flavored, is baked. The proportion that\\nhas been accepted as ideal to produce a dessert of the right thickness\\nis one egg to each cupful of milk; however, an entire egg is not always\\nrequired, as one yolk is often sufficient to thicken 1 cupful of milk.\\nCare should be taken in the cooking of such custards, for if they are\\ncooked too long or at too high a temperature they will curdle and whey;\\nwhereas, a properly cooked custard--that is, one cooked slowly at a low\\ntemperature and for the required length of time--will have a smooth,\\njellylike consistency. A slight variation in a dish of this kind is\\nsecured by reducing the number of eggs and thickening it with corn\\nstarch or some other starchy material. While such a mixture is not a\\ntrue custard, it makes an excellent dessert.\\n\\n44. In the cooking of mixtures containing eggs, no utensil proves quite\\nso satisfactory as the double boiler, which has already been explained\\nand illustrated. In fact, it is almost impossible to cook an egg mixture\\ndirectly over the flame on account of the difficulty encountered in\\npreventing the eggs from curdling. The low temperature at which cooking\\nis possible in the double boiler makes it a comparatively simple matter\\nto bring a mixture to the proper consistency without the formation of\\ncurds. Still, a certain amount of precaution must be taken even with a\\ndouble boiler. If the degree of heat that is reached in this utensil is\\napplied too long, the result will be no more satisfactory than when\\nmixtures are exposed directly to the heat and cooked at a high\\ntemperature. While every effort should be made to cook mixtures\\ncontaining eggs, such as custards or mayonnaise, so as to prevent curds\\nfrom forming, occasionally they will form in spite of all that can be\\ndone. However, it is sometimes possible to remedy the matter by placing\\nthe vessel at once in cold water and beating the mixture rapidly with a\\nDover egg beater until the curds disappear. The cold water cools the\\nmixture and prevents the formation of more curds, and the beating breaks\\nup those which have already formed, provided they are not too hard.\\n\\n45. In addition to the uses already mentioned, eggs have numerous other\\nuses in cooking with which the housewife should be familiar. For\\ninstance, slightly beaten egg is used to a great extent to make crumbs\\nor meal adhere to the surface of croquettes, meat, oysters, etc. that\\nare to be saut\\u00e9d or fried in deep fat, a coating of this kind preventing\\nthe food from becoming soaked with grease. In addition, egg is used to\\nstick flour together for certain kinds of dough, such as noodles. Then,\\nagain, it is much used to puff up mixtures and produce a hollow space in\\nthem, as in popovers and cream puffs. While such mixtures do not require\\nbeating, spongy mixtures, such as omelets and sponge cakes, do. In\\nthese, eggs are an important factor, and they must be thoroughly beaten\\nin order to incorporate the air in small bubbles and thus produce the\\ndesired texture.\\n\\n\\nSERVING OF EGGS\\n\\n46. The manner of serving eggs depends, of course, on the way in which\\nthey are cooked. One point, however, that should never be overlooked, so\\nfar as eggs that are to be served hot is concerned, is that they should\\nbe served immediately upon being prepared, so that they will not have\\nan opportunity to become cool before being eaten. This applies\\nparticularly to any spongy mixture, such as puff omelet and souffl\\u00e9, as\\nthese dishes shrink upon standing and become less appetizing in both\\nappearance and texture.\\n\\nSeveral ways of serving soft-cooked eggs are in practice, but probably\\nthe most satisfactory way is to serve them in egg cups. In case cups are\\nused, they should be heated before being placed on the table, as the\\nheat that they retain helps to keep the eggs warm. The eggs may be\\nremoved from the shell into the cup and eaten from the cup, or the\\nunbroken egg may be placed point downwards in the small end of the cup,\\na small piece broken from the broad end of the shell, and the egg then\\neaten from the shell through the opening made in it. If egg cups are not\\navailable, the eggs may be removed from the shell and served in small\\ndessert dishes, which also should be heated.\\n\\nMany egg dishes are made more attractive and appetizing by means of a\\ngarnish of some kind. Small strips or triangular pieces of toast, sprays\\nof parsley, celery leaves, lettuce, and strips of pimiento are very\\nsatisfactory for this purpose. If no other garnish is desired, just a\\nsprinkling of paprika adds a touch of color.\\n\\n47. In connection with the serving of eggs it will be well to note that\\nthey have a tendency to adhere to china and to discolor silver.\\nTherefore, in the washing of china and the cleaning of silver that have\\nbeen used in the serving of raw or slightly cooked eggs, much care\\nshould be exercised. Dishes in which eggs of this kind have been served\\nshould first be washed in cool water in order to remove all the egg, and\\nthen they should be thoroughly washed in hot water. If the hot water is\\napplied first, the heat will cause the egg to coagulate and cling to the\\ndishes. Silver that comes in contact with eggs tarnishes or becomes\\ndiscolored through the action of the sulphur that is found in them, just\\nas it does when it is exposed to the air. Dark spots that appear on\\nsilver from this source may be removed by means of a good\\nsilver cleaner.\\n\\n EGG RECIPES\\n\\n48. To enable the housewife to prepare many of the dishes already\\nmentioned, as well as many other egg dishes, a number of recipes are\\nhere given. These recipes pertain to the cooking of eggs alone in\\nvarious ways or to dishes in which eggs are the leading ingredient.\\nThere are, of course, numerous other dishes in which eggs are required,\\nsuch as custards, cakes, mayonnaise, etc., but these are omitted here,\\nas recipes for them are included in the lessons that pertain directly to\\nthem. In the first few recipes, the ingredients are omitted and merely\\ndirections given, for the eggs themselves are practically the only thing\\nrequired, especially so far as the cooking is concerned. However, in the\\nmajority of cases, the ingredients are listed in the usual manner and\\nexplicit directions then given for carrying out the recipe.\\n\\n49. SOFT-COOKED, OR JELLIED, EGGS.--Eggs that are cooked soft, or\\njellied, may be used for any meal in which plain eggs can be served.\\nWhen properly prepared, they are both digestible and attractive, and any\\nperson who is able to eat eggs at all can eat them in this form.\\n\\nTo prepare soft-cooked, or jellied, eggs, first bring to the boiling\\npoint sufficient water to cover well the desired number of eggs, which\\nis usually 1 pint of water to each egg. Then drop the eggs into the\\nwater carefully, remove the pan from the fire, place a cover on it, and\\nset it on the back of the stove, where the water will not heat further\\nnor cool too rapidly. Allow the eggs to remain in the water for\\n5 minutes.\\n\\nWhen eggs cooked in this manner are served, they will be found to be the\\nconsistency of jelly all the way through. This method of cooking is\\npreferable to boiling them for 3, 4, or 5 minutes, because boiling cooks\\nthe white just inside the shell very hard, while the yolk of the egg\\nremains liquid.\\n\\n50. POACHED EGGS.--Eggs properly poached make a very attractive\\nbreakfast dish, but the poaching should be well done in order to have\\nthe dish attractive and digestible. The food value of a plain poached\\negg is, of course, identically the same as that of a soft-cooked, a\\nhard-cooked, or a raw egg. Eggs are usually poached in a shallow pan,\\nalthough egg poachers are to be had.\\n\\nTo poach eggs in a shallow pan, pour into the pan sufficient water to\\ncover the eggs that are to be cooked, add a teaspoonful of salt or of\\nvinegar for each pint of water, and bring it to the boiling point.\\nRemove the pan from the flame or reduce the heat so that the water will\\ncease to boil. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer and then\\nslide them carefully into the water. Do not allow the water to boil\\nafter the eggs have been added, as boiling toughens the egg white and in\\naddition causes considerable loss by tearing it into shreds. When the\\neggs are set, remove them carefully from the water and season them with\\nsalt and pepper. A convenient way to remove the eggs is to use a large\\nspoon that has holes in the bowl for draining off the water. The salt or\\nvinegar is added to the water before cooking in order to solidify the\\nalbumen and keep it in a mass.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\\n\\nAn egg poacher contains a perforated section of metal just large enough\\nto hold an egg. In poaching eggs with such a utensil, the perforated\\npart is placed over a pan of boiling water; then the egg is carefully\\nslid into it, and allowed to poach. Eggs prepared in this way are really\\ncooked by steam and are found to be very satisfactory.\\n\\n51. POACHED EGGS ON TOAST.--Eggs poached according to the directions\\njust given can be made both appetizing and attractive by serving them on\\ntoast, as shown in Fig. 12; indeed, the addition of toast to a poached\\negg adds a quantity of carbohydrate, a food principle in which the egg\\nis lacking. If the toast is buttered, fat is added, and such a dish,\\ntogether with fruit, makes a very excellent breakfast. A slice of toast\\nof medium size with the usual amount of butter and egg will have a food\\nvalue of about 225 calories. In preparing poached eggs on toast, the\\nusual custom is to butter slices of freshly made toast, moisten them\\nwith hot milk or cream, and place on them freshly poached eggs. The eggs\\nare then seasoned with salt and pepper, and, if desired, a little piece\\nof butter may be dropped on each one. To add to the attractiveness of\\nsuch a dish, the toast may be cut round with a cookie cutter or a square\\npiece may be cut diagonally to make two triangular pieces.\\n\\n52. HARD-COOKED EGGS.--Eggs that are cooked hard may be served hot or\\ncold, or they may be used in numerous ways, as, for example, to garnish\\na dish to which the addition of protein is desirable or to supply a\\nhigh-protein dish for some light meal.\\n\\nTo prepare hard-cooked eggs, bring to the boiling point sufficient water\\nto cover well the desired number of eggs, about 1 pint of water for each\\negg to be cooked usually being sufficient. Carefully drop the eggs into\\nthe water and place the pan on the back of the stove where the water\\nwill not boil, but will stay hot. Allow the eggs to remain in the hot\\nwater for 45 minutes; then remove them, and if they are desired hot,\\nserve them at once. If they are not to be served hot, pour cold water\\nover them and allow them to cool before removing the shells in order to\\nprevent the yolks from discoloring.\\n\\nWhen prepared in this way, eggs will be found to be tender and at the\\nsame time well cooked; whereas, if they are cooked at the boiling point,\\nthey are certain to be tough and leathery and consequently less\\ndigestible.\\n\\n53. FRIED EGGS.--Fried eggs are likely to be more or less indigestible,\\nbecause the hot fat coagulates the protein and makes it very hard. The\\naddition of fat, however, increases the food value of the eggs to a\\ncertain extent. To fry eggs, melt enough butter or other fat in a frying\\npan to cover its surface well. Break the eggs one at a time into a\\nsaucer and slip them into the hot fat. Season with salt and pepper. Fry\\nuntil the white has become well solidified on the bottom, and then\\neither turn them over or put a few drops of water in the pan and cover\\nit tight with a cover, so that the steam will cook the top of the egg.\\nFry until the desired degree of hardness has been obtained, and\\nthen serve.\\n\\n54. SCRAMBLED EGGS.--A pleasing variety from the usual methods of\\npreparation is offered by means of scrambled eggs, which are not\\ndifficult to make. Too long cooking, however, should be guarded against,\\nfor it will cause the protein in the eggs to become too hard and to\\nseparate from the liquid and will produce watery scrambled eggs. To be\\nmost satisfactory, they should be taken from the pan just before they\\nhave finished cooking, for the heat that they hold will complete it.\\nEggs prepared in this way, according to the accompanying recipe, may be\\nserved on toast or with ham and bacon. If they are served with meat, a\\nsmaller portion of meat should be given to a person than is\\nordinarily served.\\n\\nSCRAMBLED EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n3/4 c. milk\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. butter\\n\\nBeat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk and seasonings. Melt\\nthe butter in a frying pan and, when the butter is hot, pour the egg\\nmixture into it. As the eggs begin to thicken, stir them up from the\\nbottom of the pan and continue to stir them until the entire mass has\\nthickened slightly. Before the eggs are entirely cooked, remove them\\nfrom the pan. Bacon and ham fat may be used instead of butter, and they\\nare strongly recommended if they can be secured, for they lend an\\nexcellent flavor to scrambled eggs.\\n\\n55. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATO.--The addition of tomato to scrambled\\neggs lends an unusual flavor as well as a little variety to the dish.\\nThe same conditions apply to the cooking of scrambled eggs with tomato\\nas apply to plain scrambled eggs; namely, that too long cooking ruins\\nthem. The onion included in the recipe here given may be omitted from\\nthe dish if it is not desirable. The fat to be used may be in the form\\nof butter, although bacon or ham fat may be substituted to give an\\nagreeable flavor.\\n\\nSCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATO\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 Tb. fat\\n1 slice onion\\n1 c. stewed tomatoes\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n6 eggs\\n\\nPut the fat into a frying pan, and when this grease is hot add the slice\\nof onion and fry it until it is brown. Remove the onion from the fat,\\nand add the stewed tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Then beat the eggs\\nslightly and add them to the hot tomato. Stir the mixture slowly from\\nthe bottom of the pan until it is slightly thickened. Remove from the\\npan and serve hot.\\n\\n56. SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST.--The addition of cheese to eggs, as in the\\naccompanying recipe, makes a dish that is very high in protein and\\nusually pleasing in flavor. So as not to overcook the eggs in this dish,\\nthey should be cooked only slightly in the pan, because they receive\\nadditional cooking when the dish is placed in the oven to melt the\\ncheese. Browning the cheese slightly on top makes a very attractive\\ndish, especially when garnished with parsley.\\n\\nSCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n3/4 c. milk\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. fat\\n1/2 c. grated cheese\\n6 slices of toast\\n\\nBeat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk, salt, and pepper. Melt\\nthe fat in a frying pan, and when it is hot add the egg mixture. Stir\\nthe mixture as it cooks until it has thickened slightly; then pour it\\nover the slices of toast placed in a shallow pan. Sprinkle the grated\\ncheese over the top, and place under a lighted broiler or in a very hot\\noven until the cheese melts. Remove to a platter garnish with parsley,\\nand serve.\\n\\n57. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM.--The accompanying recipe affords an\\nexcellent way in which to use up the little scraps of ham that may be\\ncut from the bone when it is impossible to cut enough nice looking\\npieces to serve as a cold dish. Eggs prepared in this way will be found\\nvery tasty and will take the place of a meat dish for luncheon\\nor supper.\\n\\nSCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n1 c. milk\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1 c. chopped cooked ham\\n2 Tb. fat\\n\\nBeat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk, salt, pepper, and ham.\\nMelt the fat in a frying pan and scramble the mixture as directed in\\nArt. 54 until it is slightly thickened. Remove from the stove and serve\\nat once. If desired, this dish may be served on toast. Other left-over\\nmeat, such as roast beef or pork, may be used in place of ham, but such\\nmeats do not make so tasty a dish, the flavor of ham in such a\\ncombination being more desirable.  58. PLAIN OMELET.--The simplest type\\nof omelet, which is known as plain omelet, does not differ materially\\nfrom scrambled eggs, except that the whole is collected in a mass in an\\nomelet shape. No difficulty will be experienced in making such an omelet\\nif the directions in the recipe here given are followed explicitly. To\\nmake this dish more attractive, some food of a contrasting color, such\\nas jelly or tomatoes, may be used for garnishing.\\n\\nPLAIN OMELET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n6 Tb. water\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n3 Tb. fat\\n\\nBeat the eggs, and to them add the water, salt, and pepper. Heat the fat\\nin an omelet pan or a small frying pan, and when it is hot add the egg\\nmixture. When the egg on the bottom of the pan has thickened, tip the\\npan and draw the thickened portion toward the handle with the end of a\\nknife, allowing the uncooked egg to run over the pan, and when that has\\nthickened on the bottom, draw it up as before. Repeat until all of the\\negg has been cooked and an oblong-shaped omelet is formed. Place on a\\nhot platter or plate, garnish with parsley or jelly, and serve.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\\n\\n59. PUFF OMELET.--Many housewives consider it to be a very difficult\\nthing to make a puff omelet successfully; but such need not be the case\\nif fresh eggs are used and the usual amount of care is taken in its\\npreparation. The whites of the eggs must not be over-beaten, as too much\\nbeating will cause the loss of air and will not permit the omelet to\\nbecome sufficiently light. Another precaution is that the mixture should\\nnot be overcooked, for the application of heat after it has been\\nsufficiently cooked will cause it to shrink. How a puff omelet made\\naccording to the recipe here given should look, is shown in Fig. 13.\\nThis is a very pleasing dish and never fails to appeal to those persons\\nwho are fond of eggs.\\n\\nPUFF OMELET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 Tb. bread crumbs\\n4 Tb. milk\\n4 eggs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n3 Tb. fat\\n\\nSoak the bread crumbs in the milk. Separate the yolks and whites of the\\neggs. Beat the egg yolks and add them to the crumbs and milk. Add the\\nsalt and pepper. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them carefully\\ninto the yolk mixture. Heat the fat in an omelet pan or a frying pan,\\nand when it is hot pour the mixture into it. Cook over a very slow fire,\\nbeing careful not to burn the mixture, until a knife can be slipped\\nunder and the whole mixture raised. By this time the top should be quite\\npuffed up. Place the pan in a hot oven, where the omelet should puff\\nstill more, and cook until it is no longer raw. With a knife, score\\nacross through the center on a straight line with the handle. Then\\ncarefully fold the omelet double, roll it out on a hot platter or plate,\\nas shown in Fig. 14, garnish with parsley, and serve at once. If an\\nomelet of this kind stands for any length of time after it is served, it\\nwill shrink and be much less appetizing.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\\n\\n60. CHEESE OMELET.--If an additional amount of protein in the form of\\ncasein is desired in an omelet, the accompanying recipe for cheese\\nomelet should be tried. The addition of cheese makes this dish even a\\nbetter meat substitute than either the plain or the puff omelet.\\nLikewise, the cheese adds flavor, which may be increased if desired by\\nthe addition of more cheese than the recipe calls for. Although this\\nrecipe mentions butter, fat other than butter may be used.\\n\\nCHEESE OMELET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1/2 c. grated cheese\\n2 Tb. bread crumbs\\n4 Tb. milk\\n4 eggs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n3 Tb. butter\\n\\nMix the grated cheese with the bread crumbs, milk, egg yolks, salt, and\\npepper. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and fold them into the\\nother ingredients. To cook the omelet, proceed according to the\\ndirections given for making puff omelet in Art. 59.\\n\\n61. TOMATO OMELET.--The addition of tomatoes to an omelet makes an\\nattractive dish as far as color is concerned, and, at the same time, it\\ngives variety by improving the flavor. Such an omelet is also less\\nconcentrated than a plain omelet, for the tomatoes provide bulk and\\nadditional water is added. While in a way these lower the food value of\\nthe dish, the loss is more than made up by the qualities that are added.\\n\\nTOMATO OMELET\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n1/2 c. milk\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n3 Tb. fat\\n2 medium-sized ripe tomatoes\\n\\nBeat the eggs, and to them add the milk, salt, and pepper. Heat the fat\\nin a pan large enough to make the egg mixture 1/2 inch deep when poured\\ninto it. Cook slowly until it is well done. Peel and cut the tomatoes\\ninto slices 1/3 inch thick. Place the sliced tomatoes on 1/2 of the\\nomelet, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, score the omelet through the\\ncenter, and fold the other half over the tomatoes. Then slide the omelet\\non a hot platter, garnish with lettuce or parsley, and serve at once.\\n\\n62. VARIETY IN OMELETS.--From the recipes given for omelets, it will be\\nnoted that this dish may be made plain or may be varied by adding\\ningredients that provide flavoring or increase the nutritive value. In\\naddition to the suggestions that have been made in these recipes, there\\nis an almost endless number of ways in which omelets may be varied. For\\ninstance, left-over bits of any kind of meat, such as a roast, a steak,\\nor chops, from the day before or bits of bacon fried for a previous meal\\nmay be chopped fine and utilized for this purpose. Cheese cut fine or\\ngrated and mixed with the eggs helps to make a delicious omelet. Bread\\ncrumbs, cracker crumbs, rice, riced potatoes, or left-over cereal may\\nbe used, as well as mushrooms, chopped or whole, and oysters raw or\\npreviously scalloped or fried and then chopped. Bits of fish, such as\\nleft-over crab or lobster, will do nicely for increasing variety. Often\\njelly, jam, and fruit or vegetables are folded inside after the omelet\\nis cooked.\\n\\n63. STUFFED EGGS.--A highly seasoned cold dish that is delicious for\\npicnics or cold lunches can be made by removing the yolks from\\nhard-cooked eggs, seasoning them, and then stuffing them into the\\nwhites, as is explained in the recipe here given. Eggs so prepared also\\nmake a desirable high-protein dish for summer weather when meat dishes\\nfail to appeal to the appetite. Wafers or tiny bread-and-butter\\nsandwiches served with stuffed eggs make them more attractive.\\n\\nSTUFFED EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 hard-cooked eggs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1/8 tsp. paprika\\n1/2 tsp. mustard\\n2 Tb. vinegar\\n\\nCut the eggs in half, either lengthwise or crosswise. Remove the yolks,\\nmash them, add to them the salt, pepper, paprika, mustard, and vinegar,\\nand mix thoroughly. Fill the egg whites with the yolk mixture. The eggs\\nwill be much more appetizing in appearance if the yolk is not packed\\nsmoothly back into the white but allowed to stand up roughly. The plate\\non which the eggs are served should be nicely garnished with lettuce,\\nparsley, or celery leaves.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\\n\\n64. CREAMED EGGS.--If a dish that will serve well for luncheon or a\\nlight supper is desired, creamed eggs, as illustrated in Fig. 15, will\\nbe found very satisfactory, for the cream sauce that is served on them\\nand the toast on which the eggs are placed add carbohydrate to an\\notherwise high-protein dish. The eggs used in this dish must be\\nhard-cooked in water, so as not to be indigestible. Paprika sprinkled\\nover the top and parsley used as a garnish add colors that make the dish\\nvery attractive.\\n\\nCREAMED EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1-1/2 c. milk\\n2 Tb. fat\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. paprika\\n6 hard-cooked eggs\\n6 slices of toast\\n\\nHeat the milk. Put the fat in a saucepan and heat it until it is light\\nbrown; then add the flour, salt, and paprika to the melted fat and mix\\nall thoroughly. Pour in the hot milk and stir the mixture constantly\\nuntil the sauce has become smooth and thick. Cut the hard-cooked eggs\\ninto halves while they are hot, and place two halves with the cut sides\\ndown on each piece of toast. Pour the white sauce over all, sprinkle\\nwith paprika, and serve.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16]\\n\\n65. Eggs \\u00e0 la Goldenrod.--Closely resembling creamed eggs in composition\\nand food value, but differing from them somewhat in appearance, are eggs\\n\\u00e0 la goldenrod, which are illustrated in Fig. 16. This is, perhaps, even\\na more attractive dish if it is nicely made than creamed eggs, and many\\npersons who do not like hard-cooked eggs find this dish agreeable and\\nare able to digest it.\\n\\nEGGS \\u00c0 LA GOLDENROD\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. milk\\n2 Tb. fat\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n4 hard-cooked eggs\\n6 slices of toast\\n\\nHeat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add the flour, salt, and\\npepper, and mix well. Then add the hot milk and stir until the sauce\\nthickens. Chop the whites of the hard-cooked eggs into small pieces, and\\nmix them with the white sauce. Arrange the toast on a platter and pour\\nthe sauce over it. Put the hard-cooked egg yolks through a sieve or a\\nricer and sprinkle them on top of the white sauce. Serve hot.\\n\\n66. SCALLOPED EGGS.--A quantity of carbohydrate is added to eggs when\\nthey are scalloped, for the white sauce and the cracker crumbs that are\\nused in this dish supply this food substance. The cold meat that this\\ndish requires and that should be well chopped into small pieces may be\\nleft-over from roasted, stewed, or even broiled meat. As this provides\\nan additional amount of protein, the dish on the whole serves as an\\nexcellent substitute for meat with carbohydrate added.\\n\\nSCALLOPED EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. milk\\n2 Tb. fat\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 c. cracker crumbs\\n4 hard-cooked eggs\\n1 c. chopped cold meat\\n\\nHeat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add the salt, pepper, and\\nflour, and mix well. To this add the hot milk. Cook until the sauce\\nthickens, stirring constantly. Grease a baking dish and place in it 1/3\\ncupful of the cracker crumbs. Over the crumbs arrange two of the eggs\\nsliced thinly, and on the top of the eggs put half of the meat. Repeat\\nby adding a layer of 1/3 cupful of the crumbs, the remaining eggs\\nsliced, and the remainder of the meat. Pour the white sauce over all and\\narrange the remaining 1/3 cupful of crumbs on top. Bake in a moderate\\noven for 1/2 hour. Serve hot from the baking dish.\\n\\n67. INDIVIDUAL BAKING DISHES FOR EGG RECIPES.--Although the directions\\ngiven in the preceding recipe for scalloped eggs state that this recipe\\nis baked in a baking dish, it is not necessary that one large dish of\\nthis kind be used, for, if desired, individual baking dishes may be\\nsubstituted. In fact, any recipe for which a large baking dish would\\nordinarily be used may be baked in the small dishes used for a single\\nserving, and eggs prepared in this way are especially attractive. Such\\ndishes are also used for the baking of custards or the molding of jelly\\nand blanc mange. Since they prove very useful and find so much favor,\\nit is advisable for every housewife to add a few of them to her supply\\nof utensils and to become familiar with the varieties that can be\\nsecured and the proper way to use them.\\n\\nDishes of this kind may be purchased in both cheap and expensive\\nvarieties and in plain or fancy styles, being made of white porcelain,\\nof glass, or of the brown ware so much used for large baking dishes and\\ncasseroles and having a white glazing on the inside.\\n\\n68. When such dishes are used as a means of adding variety to the\\ncooking and serving of eggs, they should be placed in the oven in a\\nshallow pan containing enough hot water to come nearly to the top of\\nthem. The object of this plan is to keep the temperature uniform. As\\nlong as the dishes are surrounded by water, the food to be cooked will\\nnot attain a greater heat than 212 degrees Fahrenheit, because the\\nsurrounding water cannot reach a higher temperature. Food cooked in this\\nway will be found to be baked much more evenly and to be of a better\\nconsistency than food that is subjected to the high temperature of the\\noven. Most of the recipes that follow, while they can be baked in large\\nbaking dishes if desired and then served from the dish, are designed\\nparticularly to be used in individual baking dishes.\\n\\n69. BAKED EGGS IN CREAM.--A dish that is particularly desirable for\\nbreakfast, but that may be served for luncheon, is made by baking eggs\\nin cream according to the accompanying recipe. Besides being very\\nappetizing, this dish is high in food value because of the addition of\\nthe cream and fat. Crisp toast served with eggs prepared in this way is\\nvery delightful.\\n\\nBAKED EGGS IN CREAM\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 eggs\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\n3/4 c. cream\\n\\nGrease six individual baking dishes and break an egg into each. Put a\\nsmall piece of butter on top of each egg and season with salt and\\npepper. Pour over each egg two tablespoonfuls of cream. Place the baking\\ndishes in a shallow pan of hot water and bake until the eggs are as hard\\nas desired. Serve hot.\\n\\n70. SHIRRED EGGS WITH HAM.--An excellent way in which to utilize scraps\\nof ham is to combine them with eggs to make a dish that may be served\\nin place of meat. This dish, besides being high in food value, is very\\ntasty because of the flavor of the ham and the fact that it is quite\\nhighly seasoned.\\n\\nSHIRRED EGGS WITH HAM\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1/2 tsp. prepared mustard\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\n1 c. chopped ham\\n6 eggs\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1 Tb. butter\\n\\nGrease six individual baking dishes. Mix the mustard and pepper with the\\nham, and then divide this mixture as evenly as possible into the baking\\ndishes. Break an egg on top of the ham in each dish, season with salt,\\nand put a small piece of butter on each. Place the dishes in a shallow\\npan of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are well set\\nor hardened. Remove from the oven and serve at once.\\n\\n71. EGG SOUFFL\\u00c9.--If a delicate dish for children or invalids is\\ndesired, egg souffl\\u00e9 will answer the purpose very well. This dish is\\nlight in character, but it is high in protein and to most persons is\\nvery delightful. It is more attractive if baked in individual baking\\ndishes, but it may be baked in a large baking dish and served directly\\nfrom the dish. To improve the flavor of egg souffl\\u00e9 and make it a more\\nappetizing dish, tomato sauce is often served with it.\\n\\nEGG SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1 c. milk\\n2 Tb. fat\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1 Tb. chopped parsley\\n4 eggs\\n\\nHeat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add to it the flour, salt,\\nand parsley, and mix well. Pour in the hot milk, stir constantly until\\nthe sauce thickens, and then remove from the fire. Separate the eggs and\\nadd the well-beaten yolks to the sauce, stirring rapidly so that the egg\\nwill not curd. Beat the whites stiff and fold them carefully into the\\nsauce. Turn into well-greased individual baking dishes until they are\\nabout two-thirds full, place in a shallow pan of hot water, and bake\\nuntil firm when touched with the finger. Serve at once in the dishes in\\nwhich they are baked, because they shrink when they are allowed to cool.\\n\\n72. The tomato sauce that is often served with egg souffl\\u00e9 is made as\\nfollows:\\n\\nTOMATO SAUCE\\n\\n1 1/2 c. strained stewed tomatoes\\n2 Tb. fat\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. flour\\n\\nForce enough stewed tomatoes through a sieve to make 1 1/2 cupfuls of\\nstrained tomato. Heat the strained tomato and to it add the fat, salt,\\nand pepper. Moisten the flour with a little cold water and add it to the\\nhot tomato. Cook for 5 minutes. Serve over the souffl\\u00e9.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17]\\n\\n73. Alpine Eggs.--It is rather unusual to combine cream or cottage\\ncheese with eggs, so that when this is done, as in the accompanying\\nrecipe, a dish that is out of the ordinary is the result. If not a\\nsufficient amount of cottage cheese is in supply to serve for a meal, it\\nmay very well be used for this dish. Otherwise, cream cheese\\nserves nicely.\\n\\nALPINE EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 10-cent pkgs. cream cheese or\\n1 c. cottage cheese\\n2 Tb. finely chopped parsley\\n1/8 tsp. paprika\\n6 eggs\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1 1/2 tsp. salt\\n\\nGrease six individual baking dishes. Break up the cheese with a fork and\\nsprinkle a layer on the bottom of each dish. Break an egg in each dish\\nover the cheese. Season with salt. Sprinkle a layer of cheese on top of\\nthe egg, and over that put chopped parsley, paprika, and a small piece\\nof butter. Place the baking dishes in a shallow pan of hot water and\\nbake in a moderate oven until the eggs are set. Remove from the oven and\\nserve at once.\\n\\n74. Clipped Eggs.--The chief value of clipped eggs is their appearance,\\nwhich, as will be observed in Fig. 17, is very attractive. This dish\\nadds much to the breakfast tray of an invalid or will tempt the\\nappetite of a child who does not feel like eating. But in addition to\\nbeing attractive, this dish is high in food value, for in this respect\\nit is exactly equivalent to a poached egg on toast or a plain egg served\\nwith a piece of toast to which is added a small amount of butter.\\n\\nCLIPPED EGGS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 pieces toast\\n3 Tb. butter\\n6 eggs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n\\nButter the toast with some of the butter. Separate the whites and yolks\\nof the eggs without breaking the yolks. Beat the whites stiff, and put a\\nmound of the beaten white on top of each piece of buttered toast. Make a\\nhole in the center of the mound of egg white and drop the unbroken yolk\\ninto it. Season each with salt and pepper and bits of the remaining\\nbutter. Place in a hot oven and bake until the yolk is set and the white\\nslightly browned. Serve hot.\\n\\n75. LEFT-OVER EGGS.--It is not a difficult matter to utilize eggs in any\\nform in which they may be left over, for they combine readily with many\\nother foods. For instance, left-over hard-cooked eggs may be sliced or\\nchopped and used to garnish dishes of vegetables, meat, fish, or salads.\\nEggs cooked in this way may also be stuffed according to the recipe\\ngiven in Art. 63, or they may be crushed and mixed with seasoning for\\nsandwiches. If any soft-cooked eggs remain after a meal, they should be\\nhard-cooked in order to be used to the best advantage. Left-over omelet\\nor scrambled, poached, or fried eggs may be chopped and added to soups,\\nsauces, or gravies, or combined with small pieces of meat or fish and\\nused with crumbs and white sauce to make a scalloped dish.\\n\\nEven uncooked eggs that are taken from the shells, but that cannot be\\nused at once, need not be wasted if proper care is given to them to\\nprevent the formation of a hard crust over their surface. Such eggs\\nshould be put into a dish that will allow as little of the surface as\\npossible to be exposed and should be covered with cold water and kept in\\na cool place. When they are desired for use, the water should be poured\\noff carefully so as to prevent the loss of any of the egg.\\n\\n BREAKFAST MENU\\n\\n76. So that a definite idea may be formed of the student's progress in\\ncookery, there is here presented a breakfast menu that is to be prepared\\nand reported on at the same time that the answers to the Examination\\nQuestions are sent. This menu is practical and it may be easily\\nprepared, as all the dishes it contains have already been considered.\\n\\nMENU\\n\\nSliced Bananas\\nCream of Wheat\\nGraham Muffins\\nButter\\nPuff Omelet\\nCoffee\\n\\nIn most homes, breakfast is a meal that is gathered together with as\\nlittle thought and preparation as possible. The reason for this is that\\nthe housewife feels that she does not wish to rise early enough in the\\nmorning to prepare an elaborate menu. Breakfast, however, should be the\\nmost attractive meal in the day, because it is one that gives to each\\nmember of the family the right start for the day and sustains him until\\nluncheon time. In most cases, a cup of coffee and a slice or two of\\ntoast do not start one with a cheerful attitude, nor do they contain\\nsufficient food value to nourish the individual properly. With a little\\nforethought and planning, certain foods may be partly prepared for\\nbreakfast the day before. If this is done, the time required for the\\nactual preparation of the breakfast need not be greatly increased. For\\nexample, in the accompanying menu, the cream of wheat may be cooked the\\nevening before, the materials for the graham muffins measured, and even\\nthe pan in which they are to be baked greased, and the materials for the\\nomelet collected and measured. If all this is done, the preparation\\nnecessary in the morning will consist merely of slicing the bananas,\\nreheating the cream of wheat, preparing the coffee, baking the muffins,\\nand making the omelet. While the coffee and cream of wheat are heating\\nor cooking, the oven will be heating, so that when the muffins are mixed\\nit will be ready to bake them; and while these are baking the omelet may\\nbe prepared. When this is done, all will be ready to serve.\\n\\n EGGS\\n\\nEXAMINATION QUESTIONS\\n\\n(1) Give a brief description of the physical structure of an egg.\\n\\n(2) (_a_) Why are eggs an important article of diet?

As understood in cookery, VEGETABLES refer to plants or parts of\\nplants that are used as food. Vegetables may consist of the entire\\nplant, as, for example, the beet; the stem, as asparagus and celery; the\\nroot, as carrot and turnip; the underground stem, or tuber, as the white\\npotato and onion; the foliage, as cabbage and spinach; the flower of the\\nplant, as cauliflower; the pods, which hold the seeds of the plant or\\nthe seeds themselves, as peas and beans; or that which in reality is\\nfruit, although for table use always considered a vegetable, as the\\ntomato and eggplant.\\n\\n2. Because of this large assortment, vegetables afford the greatest\\npossible variety in flavor, appearance, texture, quality, and food\\nvalue. They therefore assume a place of very great importance in the\\ndiet of individuals and in the plans of the housewife who has all the\\nmeals to prepare for her family. In fact, there is scarcely a meal,\\nexcept breakfast, at which vegetables are not served. For dinner, they\\nform a part or all of each course in the meal, except, perhaps, the\\ndessert, and occasionally they may be used for this.\\n\\nAlthough two or more vegetables are nearly always served in even a\\nsimple meal, the use of vegetables in most households is limited to\\nthose few varieties which are especially preferred by the family. As a\\nrule, there are a number of other vegetables that would be very\\nacceptable if prepared in certain appetizing ways. An effort should\\ntherefore be made to include all such vegetables in the dietary, for\\nthey may be used to decided advantage and at the same time they afford\\nvariety in the meals. The constant demand for variety in this food makes\\nacceptable new recipes for the preparation of the vegetables already\\nknown and information for the use of the unfamiliar kinds.\\n\\n3. Great variety also exists in the flavor of vegetables, which they\\nderive from their volatile oils; that is, the oils that evaporate\\nrapidly on exposure to the air. In some cases, the flavor is\\ndisagreeably strong and must be dissipated, or driven away, in order to\\nmake the vegetables agreeable to the taste and to prevent them from\\ndisagreeing with those who eat them. In others, the flavor is very mild,\\nso that unless the vegetables are properly prepared the flavor may be\\nalmost lost. When the principles relating to the cooking of vegetables\\nare thoroughly understood, little difficulty will be experienced in\\npreparing them so that the flavor is dissipated or retained as the case\\nmay require.\\n\\n4. The food value of vegetables varies as much as do their form and\\nflavor, some of them having almost no food value, others having a great\\ndeal, and the remainder varying between these two extremes. The\\nhousewife who wishes to provide economically for her family and at the\\nsame time give them food that is best suited to their needs, should\\nlearn as much of the composition and food value of the various kinds of\\nvegetables as possible. If, besides acquiring this knowledge, she learns\\na variety of ways in which to prepare each kind, she will find that it\\nis possible to substitute vegetable dishes for the more expensive foods.\\nFor instance, it is often possible to substitute a vegetable dish for a\\nmeat dish several times a week, but the composition of the vegetable\\ndish must be such that it will really take the place of the meat dish.\\n\\n5. That it is possible for adults to live on vegetables alone has been\\nproved by vegetarians; that is, persons who exclude meat from the diet.\\nThey have shown that all the elements necessary to build and maintain\\nthe human body are contained in vegetables, fruits, and cereals, and\\nalso that these elements are in such quantity that it is not necessary\\nto supply them in any other way. Even if it is not desired to use such\\nfoods exclusively, as much use should be made of them as possible, for\\nthey average a lower cost than the high-protein foods, such as eggs,\\nmeat, and milk. The use of vegetables, however, need not be restricted\\nto adults, for when properly prepared they may be included to advantage\\nin the diet of very young children. In fact, children should be trained\\nto eat vegetables of all kinds, for such training not only will enable\\neach one to grow up with a correct appreciation for all edible things,\\nbut will make the preparation of meals easier for the housewife.\\n\\n6. Vegetables should receive great care in their preparation, whether\\nthe method involved is simple or complicated. Any of the methods of\\ncookery that call for the application of heat may be applied to them,\\nand in many cases they are served without cooking, merely dressing or\\nseasoning being added. Good vegetables may be ruined by improper\\npreparation, while those which are in excellent condition may be\\nimproved by the application of the correct methods in their preparation.\\nVegetables that are inexpensive but highly nutritious should be used\\nwhen it is necessary to practice economy, because, when they are\\nproperly prepared, they form a valuable addition to a meal.\\n\\n7. All varieties of vegetables are grown almost universally. This fact,\\ntogether with the facts that they mature at different times during the\\nseason, according to the climate in which they are grown, and that most\\nvarieties can be conveniently shipped, makes the season in which certain\\nfresh vegetables can be obtained much longer than it formerly was. For\\ninstance, very early in the season, long before it is possible to have\\nbeans, peas, and other vegetables in the North, they are shipped from\\nthe extreme South, and as the season advances, they mature farther and\\nfarther north. Therefore, they may be constantly supplied to the\\nnorthern markets until the time when they mature in that locality.\\n\\n8. In order not to waste vegetables and to have them in the best\\npossible condition when they are desired for preparation, every\\nhousewife should realize that the selection and care of vegetables are\\nalso important matters to consider. The selection must be learned by\\nfamiliarity with them, as well as practice in buying, and the housewife\\nmust be guided by the suitability of the vegetables and the money she\\nhas to spend for them. The care that must be given to them is determined\\nby the kinds that are purchased, some requiring one kind of care in\\nstorage and others entirely different attention.\\n\\n STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND FOOD VALUE\\n\\n9. STRUCTURE OF VEGETABLES.--Although vegetables vary greatly in\\ncomposition and consequently in food value, they are similar so far as\\nphysical structure is concerned. In general, they consist of a skeleton\\nframework that is made up of cellulose. Their digestible part is\\ncomposed of tiny cells having thin walls that confine the actual food\\nmaterial in the form of a liquid or semiliquid. As the vegetables grow\\nold, the cellulose material and the cell walls gradually toughen, with\\nthe result that old vegetables are less easily made tender than young\\nones and are not so agreeable to the taste as those which have not grown\\nhard. The total food value of vegetables, as well as of cereals, meats,\\nand, in fact, all foods, varies with the quantity of water and cellulose\\nthey contain. Therefore, the vegetables that contain the least coarse\\nmaterial are the ones that have the highest food value.\\n\\n10. The green color that characterizes many vegetables is due to a\\nsubstance called _chlorophyl_. This substance is essential to the normal\\ngrowth of plants and is present in the correct amount in only those\\nwhich are properly exposed to the sunlight. Sufficient proof of this is\\nseen in the case of vegetables that form heads, as, for instance,\\ncabbage and head lettuce. As is well known, the outside leaves are\\ngreen, while the inside ones are practically white. Since it is exposure\\nto the light that produces the green color, a vegetable or plant of any\\nkind can be bleached by merely covering it in order to keep out the\\nsunlight. This procedure also enables the plants to remain more tender\\nthan those which have been allowed to grow in the normal way and become\\ngreen. For instance, the inside leaves of a head of lettuce are always\\nvery much more tender than the green outside leaves. In fact, the center\\nof any kind of plant, that is, the leaves and the stem that appear last,\\nare more tender, possess a lighter color, and have a more delicate\\nflavor than the older ones.\\n\\n11. PROTEIN IN VEGETABLES.--Taken as a whole, vegetables are not high in\\nprotein. Some of them contain practically none of this food substance\\nand others contain a comparatively large amount, but the average is\\nrather low. Vegetables that are high in water, such as lettuce, celery,\\ntomatoes, and cucumbers, contain so little protein that the quantity is\\nnot appreciable. Such vegetables as potatoes, beets, carrots, etc.\\ncontain slightly larger quantities. Dried vegetables, such as beans,\\npeas, and lentils, contain comparatively large amounts of this\\nsubstance, and for this reason may be substituted for such high-protein\\nfoods as meat and fish.\\n\\n12. The composition of vegetable protein is only slightly different from\\nthat of animal protein. In fact, the experiments of scientists show that\\nanimal protein may be readily replaced by vegetable protein. One of\\nthese proteins is sometimes called _vegetable albumin_, but the chief\\nprotein of vegetables containing the largest amount of this substance,\\nnamely, beans, peas, and lentils, is called _legumin_, from the term\\n_legumes_, the name of this class of vegetables. It is generally agreed\\nthat vegetable protein is not so digestible as animal protein, but this\\ndisadvantage is offset by the fact that it does not bring about so much\\nintestinal trouble as does the protein of animal foods and is less\\nlikely to cause disturbances that are usually attributed to foods high\\nin this substance. Vegetable protein is affected by heat in much the\\nsame way as other protein.\\n\\nWhen any of the dry vegetables high in protein are served at a meal,\\nmeat should be eliminated, or the result will be an oversupply of\\nprotein. As this condition is not only harmful but wasteful, it is one\\nthat should receive proper consideration from the housewife.\\n\\n13. FAT IN VEGETABLES.--As vegetables as a class are low in protein, so\\nare they low in fat. In the case of some vegetables, the quantity of fat\\nthey contain is so small that it is never considered in discussing the\\nfood value of these vegetables, while in others slightly larger\\nquantities are to be found. However, on the whole, vegetables are so\\nnearly lacking in this food substance that it is necessary to supply fat\\nin their preparation and in the serving of meals in which they are\\nincluded. This is done in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of\\nthe vegetable. For instance, in order that baked beans may take the\\nplace of meat entirely, fat in the form of salt pork is usually added\\nwhen they are prepared. The pork, of course, also supplies a very small\\namount of protein, but it is not used with the beans for this purpose.\\nPractically all cooked vegetables are served with butter or with a sauce\\nthat contains fat. Green vegetables that require no cooking but are\\nserved as a salad, are supplied with fat by the salad dressing that is\\nused with them. The fat varies greatly, depending on the kind of\\ndressing used.  14. CARBOHYDRATES IN VEGETABLES.--When the composition\\nof vegetables is considered chemically, the most striking thing about\\nthem is the carbohydrates they contain. It is this that distinguishes\\nthis class of foods from animal foods. The carbohydrate of vegetables is\\nfound in both its forms, starch and sugar. It is in the form of sugar in\\nmany of the vegetables when they are young or immature, but it turns\\ninto starch as they mature. This change can be easily observed in the\\ncase of peas. As is well known, young green peas are rather sweet\\nbecause of the sugar they contain, while mature or dried peas have lost\\ntheir sweetness and are starchy. The sugar that is found in large\\nquantities in such vegetables as peas, carrots, turnips, etc. is largely\\ncane sugar. The starch that vegetables contain occurs in tiny granules,\\njust as it is found in cereals, and is affected by cooking in the same\\nway. The mature vegetables in which the starch has developed, although\\nless tender and less sweet than young ones, have a higher food value. In\\nfact, the carbohydrate that vegetables contain constitutes a large\\nproportion of their food value.\\n\\nOne of the chief sources of starch among vegetables is the potato, in\\nwhich the starch grains are large and, if properly cooked, easily\\ndigested. Irish, or white, potatoes contain very little carbohydrate in\\nthe form of sugar, but in the sweet potato much of the carbohydrate is\\nsugar. In either of these two forms--starch and sugar--vegetable\\ncarbohydrate is easily digested.\\n\\n15. MINERAL MATTER, OR ASH, IN VEGETABLES.--The mineral matter in\\nvegetables is found in comparatively large quantities, the average\\namount being slightly over 1 per cent. The presence of this substance is\\nof great value, because the mineral salts of both fruits and vegetables\\nare essential in the diet of adults in order to keep their health in a\\nnormal condition. The mineral salts of vegetables render the blood more\\nalkaline instead of more acid, as do those contained in cereals and\\nmeat. A large number of vegetables, particularly those low in food\\nvalue, such as greens, celery, etc., are very valuable for their mineral\\nsalts. In reality, this substance and the cellulose they contain are the\\nthings that recommend the use of these vegetables in the diet. Minerals\\nof all kinds are found in solution in the water contained in vegetables,\\nbut chief among them are calcium, sodium, iron, phosphorus, and sulphur.\\nGreens and salad vegetables are particularly high in iron, the element\\nthat assists in keeping the blood in good condition. These minerals are\\neasily lost if the method of cookery is not planned to retain them.\\n\\n16. CELLULOSE IN VEGETABLES.--The special use of cellulose, as has\\nalready been learned, is to serve as bulk in the food containing it. In\\nvegetables, the cellulose varies greatly as to quantity, as well as to\\ntexture and the amount that can be digested. In young vegetables, it is\\nvery soft and perhaps digestible to a certain extent, but as they grow\\nolder it hardens and they become tough. This fact is clearly\\ndemonstrated in the case of beets. Those which are pulled from the\\ngarden in the summer and cooked are tender and soft, but those which are\\nallowed to mature in the ground and are then put away for winter are,\\nwhen cooked in the late winter or early spring, so hard and tough that\\nit is almost impossible to make them soft. The quantity of cellulose\\nthat vegetables contain therefore depends largely on their age and\\ncondition. Those low in total food value contain, as a rule, larger\\nquantities of it than those high in food value. This is due to the fact\\nthat both water and cellulose, which are usually found together in large\\nquantities, help to detract from the fuel, or food, value of foods.\\n\\nVery young persons or those who are ill sometimes find it impossible to\\ntake in its original form a vegetable that contains a large amount of\\nbulk, or cellulose. In such a case, the vegetable may be put through a\\ncolander or a sieve in order to break up the cellulose and make it\\neasier to digest. Under ordinary conditions, cellulose should not be\\navoided, but should be included in large quantities in the diet through\\nthe vegetables that are consumed daily.\\n\\n17. WATER IN VEGETABLES.--The majority of vegetables contain a large\\nquantity of water. Such vegetables as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes,\\netc., which are low in total food value, contain the most water, the\\naverage percentage being about 95. The dry vegetables, which are high in\\nfood value, average only about 10 per cent. of water. The water that is\\nfound in vegetables, whether it is much or little, is contained in\\ncell-like structures surrounded by cellulose, and it holds in solution\\nthe mineral salts and much of the nutriment of the vegetables. In\\naddition, the water holds in solution to a certain extent the material\\nthat gives vegetables their distinctive flavor. When any of this water\\nis lost in the preparation of vegetables, the substances that it\\ncontains are also lost. It is therefore essential that correct methods\\nof preparation be chosen for the cooking of this food, so as to prevent\\nthe waste of valuable food materials.\\n\\n18. DIGESTIBILITY OF VEGETABLES.--The digestibility of vegetables is\\nlargely an individual matter; that is, a vegetable that agrees with one\\nperson may not agree with another. The fact that there appears to be no\\napparent reason for such a condition would lead to the conclusion that\\nit is due to the peculiarities of the person. Because of this, it is not\\nfair to make the general statement that a particular vegetable is easy\\nto digest and another one is hard to digest.\\n\\nThe chief cause for difficulty in the digestion of vegetables lies in\\ntheir volatile oils, which give them their flavor, but which are\\nirritating to many persons. Vegetables having a strong flavor, such as\\nradishes, onions, cucumbers, cabbage, and cauliflower, are the ones that\\ndisagree most frequently with persons who eat them; but sometimes the\\nway in which some of them are cooked has more to do with this than the\\nvegetables themselves.\\n\\nVegetables containing considerable cellulose and water do not of\\nthemselves give trouble in digestion, because they contain practically\\nnothing to digest; but they are sometimes responsible for interfering\\nwith the digestion of other foods. Vegetables that are extremely high in\\nstarch, such as potatoes, are easily digested by most persons, provided\\nthey are properly cooked. For instance, a plain baked potato is easily\\ndigested, but the same potato saut\\u00e9d in fat is more difficult of\\ndigestion.\\n\\n19. TABLE SHOWING COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF VEGETABLES.--As\\nvegetables vary considerably in the amount of the food substances they\\ncontain, so do they differ greatly in their food value. This is clearly\\nshown in Table I, which gives the percentage of the food substances of\\nvegetables, as well as the food value per pound, in calories, that these\\nvegetables contain. The figures in this table are taken from Atwater's\\nTable of American Food Materials, and refer to the edible portion of the\\nmaterial. In the case of several vegetables, no figures are given by\\nthis authority, but in the table here presented the percentages and the\\ncalories for the vegetables most similar are used. For example, the\\nfigures for lettuce are used for endive, as the composition and food\\nvalue of this vegetable are not included and it resembles lettuce very\\nclosely. Constant reference should be made to Table I as progress is\\nmake with the study of vegetables and their preparation. Noting the\\ndifference in the composition of the different vegetables, as well as\\nthe variation in their food value, will be not only interesting but\\ninstructive. For instance, when the housewife realizes that lettuce and\\ncelery furnish only 85 to 90 calories to the pound, while dried beans\\nand peas average more than 1,700 calories to the pound, she will\\nunderstand better the place that these foods occupy in the dietary.\\n\\nTABLE I\\n\\nCOMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF VEGETABLES\\n\\n                                                      Food Value\\nVegetable           Water  Protein  Fat  Carbo- Ash   per Pound\\n                                        hydrate        Calories\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nAsparagus .......... 94.0    1.8     .2    3.3    .7      105\\nBeans\\n  Dried ............ 12.6   22.5    1.8   59.6   3.5    1,750\\n  Lima ............. 68.5    7.1     .7   22.0   1.7      570\\n  Shelled .......... 58.9    9.4     .6   29.1   2.0      740\\n  String ........... 89.2    2.3     .3    7.4    .8      195\\nBeets .............. 87.5    1.6     .1    9.7   1.1      215\\nBrussels sprouts ... 88.2    4.7    1.1    4.3   1.7      215\\nCabbage ............ 91.5    1.6     .3    5.6   1.0      145\\nCarrots ............ 88.2    1.1     .4    9.3   1.0      210\\nCauliflower ........ 92.3    1.8     .5    4.7    .7      140\\nCelery ............. 94.5    1.1     .1    3.3   1.0       85\\nCorn ............... 75.4    3.1    1.1   19.7    .7      470\\nCucumbers .......... 95.4     .8     .2    3.1    .5       80\\nEggplant ........... 92.9    1.2     .3    5.1    .5      130\\nFrench artichokes .. 92.5     .8     .2    5.0   1.5      110\\nGreens\\n  Dandelion ........ 81.4    2.4    1.0   10.6   4.6      285\\n  Endive ........... 94.7    1.2     .3    2.9    .9       90\\n  Spinach .......... 92.3    2.1     .3    3.2   2.1      110\\n  Swiss chard ...... 92.3    2.1     .3    3.2   2.1      110\\n  Lettuce .......... 94.7    1.2     .3    2.9    .9       90\\n  Watercress ....... 94.7    1.2     .3    2.9    .9       90\\nJerusalem artichokes 79.5    2.6    2.0   16.7   1.0      365\\nKohlrabi ........... 91.1    2.0     .1    5.5   1.3      145\\nLentils, dried .....  8.4   25.7    1.0   59.2   5.7    1,620\\nMushrooms .......... 88.1    3.5     .4    6.8   1.2      210\\nOkra ............... 90.2    1.6     .2    7.4    .6      175\\nOnions ............. 87.6    1.6     .3    9.9    .6      225\\nParsnips ........... 83.0    1.6     .5   13.5   1.4      300\\nPeas\\n  Dried ............  9.5   24.6    1.0   62.0   2.9    1,655\\n  Green ............ 74.6    7.0     .5   16.9   1.0      465\\nPeppers ............ 92.9    1.2     .3    5.1    .5      130\\nPotatoes\\n  Irish ............ 78.3    2.2     .1   18.4   1.0      385\\n  Sweet ............ 69.0    1.8     .7   27.4   1.1      570\\nRadishes ........... 91.8    1.3     .1    5.8   1.0      135\\nSalsify ............ 88.2    1.1     .4    9.3   1.0      210\\nSquash\\n  Summer ........... 95.4     .8     .2    3.1    .5       80\\n  Winter ........... 88.3    1.4     .5    9.0    .8      215\\nTomatoes ........... 94.3     .9     .4    3.9    .5      105\\nTurnips ............ 89.6    1.3     .2    8.1    .8      185\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPURCHASE AND CARE OF VEGETABLES\\n\\nPURCHASE OF VEGETABLES\\n\\n20. As in the case of other foods, the purchase of vegetables in the\\nmarket requires special knowledge and attention in order that the best\\nvalue may be obtained for the money expended. The housewife who has a\\nlimited amount of money to spend for food does not buy wisely when she\\npurchases vegetables out of season or those which must be shipped long\\ndistances. On the other hand, it will be found that vegetables bought in\\nseason as well as those which are plentiful in the particular locality\\nin which they are sold, especially if they are perishable vegetables,\\nare lowest in price and are in the best condition for food. Therefore,\\nwhether the income is limited or not, it is wisdom on the part of the\\nhousewife to buy vegetables that grow in the neighboring region and to\\npurchase them when they are in season.\\n\\n21. A very important point for the housewife to keep in mind regarding\\nthe purchase of vegetables is that their price is determined not by\\ntheir value as food, but by their scarcity and the demand for them.\\nTake, for example, the case of mushrooms. As shown in Table I, this\\nvegetable is low in food value, containing only 210 calories to the\\npound, but, if purchased, they are always an expensive food. The high\\nprice asked for mushrooms is entirely dependent on their scarcity. If\\nthere is much demand in a certain community for a food that is not\\nplentiful in the market, the price of that food always goes up. As in\\nthe case of mushrooms, many expensive foods add practically nothing in\\nthe way of nourishment, their only value being in the variety of flavor\\nthey supply.\\n\\n22. Furthermore, in order to provide wisely, the person who purchases\\nvegetables for the family should be able to judge whether she is getting\\nfull value in food for the money she invests. She cannot always do this\\nwith each particular vegetable purchased, but she can buy in such a way\\nthat what she purchases will average correctly in this respect. The\\nperishable vegetables should be bought as fresh as possible. No\\ndifficulty will be experienced in determining this, for they will soon\\nwither or rot if they are not fresh, but the point is to find out their\\ncondition before they are bought. The housewife should be ever on the\\nalert and should examine carefully the vegetables she buys before they\\nare accepted from the grocer or taken from the market. In the case of\\ncertain vegetables, it is possible to conceal the fact that they are\\nstale. For instance, the outside leaves of a head of lettuce or endive\\nare sometimes removed and only the bleached center is offered for sale;\\nbut this always indicates that the outside leaves were either withered\\nor spoiled or they would not have been taken off.\\n\\n23. Much of the spoiling of vegetables can be avoided if proper\\nattention is given to them in the market. Food of this kind should be so\\ndisplayed that it is not exposed to the dirt and dust of the street, nor\\nto flies and other destructive vermin. The practice of displaying\\nvegetables on a stand in front of a store is gradually losing favor with\\nthe housewife who understands the sanitary precautions that should be\\ntaken with foods. On the other hand, housewives owe it to the merchant\\nnot to handle the foods they are going to buy, for the handling of them\\nnot only injures them so that they will not keep well, but renders them\\nunfit to be accepted by the next purchaser.\\n\\n24. The manner in which vegetables are sold should also receive\\nconsideration. It has been the custom to sell them by measure, but both\\nhousewives and merchants have come to realize that it is fairer to sell\\nthem by weight. Experience has shown that a pound is much more likely to\\nbe always uniform than is a quart or a peck. This is due to the fact\\nthat no two dealers are likely to measure in exactly the same way, even\\nthough the measures they use are up to the standard in size. Then, too,\\nespecially in the case of vegetables that are of various sizes and\\nshapes, it is impossible to fill a measure properly because of the shape\\nof the vegetables, and so either the housewife often receives short\\nmeasure or the merchant gives more than the measure requires. All\\ndifficulty of this kind is entirely overcome when vegetables\\nare weighed.\\n\\n CARE OF VEGETABLES\\n\\n25. PERISHABLE VEGETABLES, that is, those which spoil quickly, are\\nusually bought in small quantities, and so are used up quickly. However,\\nif they are kept on hand for only a day or so, they require a definite\\namount of care in order to insure the most satisfactory results in their\\nuse. To prevent them from spoiling or withering, they should be kept in\\na cool, damp place until they are needed. The most effective and\\nconvenient way in which to accomplish this is to store them in a\\nrefrigerator or other similar device. If ice cannot be obtained, the\\ncellar should be utilized. Before vegetables of this kind are put away\\nafter being delivered from the market, they should be looked over\\ncarefully, and any that are spoiled should be discarded in order to\\nprevent others that they might touch from becoming tainted. As little\\nhandling as possible, however, is advantageous, because when such foods\\nbecome bruised and are then allowed to stand they are likely to spoil\\nvery quickly.\\n\\n26. The less perishable vegetables, commonly called WINTER VEGETABLES\\nbecause they may be kept through the winter, may be bought in quantity,\\nprovided proper storage facilities to prevent them from spoiling are\\navailable. Potatoes, in particular, are usually purchased in this way,\\nfor, as a rule, they may be obtained at a better price than when bought\\nin small quantities, and then, too, they are a vegetable that most\\nfamilies use nearly every day. If they are bought in quantity, they\\nshould first be thoroughly tested, for often a potato looks very well on\\nthe outside while its texture and flavor may not be at all in accordance\\nwith its appearance. Great care should also be exercised to see that\\nthis vegetable, as well as carrots, turnips, parsnips, etc., has not\\nbeen frosted, for frost ruins them as to texture and keeping qualities.\\n\\nAll such vegetables as these, provided they must be stored for any\\nlength of time, keep best in a cold, fairly dry atmosphere. To prevent\\nthem from sprouting, the storage room should, if possible, be kept dark,\\nbut in case they do sprout, the sprouts should be removed as soon as\\nthey are discovered. The best receptacles for the storage of these\\nwinter vegetables are bins, a convenient type of which is shown in\\n_Essentials of Cookery_, Part 2, and the most satisfactory place in\\nwhich to put such bins is a cellar that has a dirt floor rather than a\\nboard or a cement floor.\\n\\n CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES\\n\\n27. Because of their difference in physical structure, both as plants or\\nparts of plants, and their variation in chemical composition, it is a\\nrather difficult matter to classify vegetables. The vegetables that are\\ndiscussed throughout these Sections are therefore not included in any\\nclasses, but are arranged alphabetically, a plan that the housewife will\\nfind very convenient. However, there are a few general classes whose\\nnames and characteristics should be known by the housewife, for an\\nunderstanding of them will enable her to make a more intelligent use of\\nthis food. These classes, together with a brief description of the\\nfeatures that characterize them and the names by which the principal\\nvarieties are known, are here given.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\\n\\n28. SUCCULENT VEGETABLES are those which are generally eaten for their\\nappetizing effect and their value as a source of mineral salts and bulk.\\nThese vegetables, which get their name from the fact that they are juicy\\nin texture, include the greens, such as spinach, Swiss chard, dandelion,\\nlettuce, etc., also celery, asparagus, cabbage, and all other plants\\nwhose green leaves and stems are edible. Succulent vegetables may be\\ncooked, but they are often used as cold relishes or in the making\\nof salads.\\n\\n29. ROOT, TUBER, and BULB VEGETABLES form another class. Examples of\\nseveral well-known roots are shown in Fig. 1, which from left to right\\nare salsify, carrots, turnips, and parsnips. The varieties included in\\nthis class are closely related as to food value, and on the whole\\naverage much higher in this characteristic than do the succulent\\nvegetables. Irish potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes are examples of\\ntubers; sweet potatoes, beets, radishes, etc., in addition to the\\nvegetables shown in Fig. 1, belong to the roots; and onions and all the\\nvegetables related to the onion, such as garlic, shallots, and leeks,\\nare illustrations of bulbs or enlarged underground stems.\\n\\n30. FRUIT and FLOWER VEGETABLES form a third class. They present great\\nvariety in appearance, structure, and composition. To this class belong\\ncucumbers, eggplant, winter and summer squash, vegetable marrow,\\ntomatoes, peppers, and okra, which are in reality fruits but are used as\\nvegetables. Flower vegetables include California, or French, artichokes,\\nand cauliflower, all of which are in reality the buds of flowers or\\nplants and are eaten for food.\\n\\n31. LEGUMES form a fourth class of vegetables, and they include all the\\nvarieties of beans, peas, and lentils. When these foods are mature and\\ndried, they have the highest food value of all the vegetables. Among the\\nbeans are Lima beans, kidney beans, navy, or soup, beans, soy beans, and\\nmany others. The peas include the various garden varieties that have\\nbeen allowed to mature, cow-peas, and many others, some of which are not\\nsuitable for human consumption. The lentils occur in numerous varieties,\\ntoo, but those commonly used are the red, yellow, and black ones. To\\nlegumes also belong peanuts, but as they are seldom used as vegetables\\nin cookery, no further mention is made of them in this Section.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nVARIETIES OF VEGETABLES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\nGENERAL METHODS OF PREPARATION AND COOKING\\n\\n32. PREPARING VEGETABLES FOR COOKING.--Before many vegetables can be\\ncooked, they require a certain amount of preparation, such as washing,\\nsoaking, peeling, cutting up into suitable sizes, etc. When they must be\\npeeled, great care should be taken not to remove too much of the\\nvegetable with the skin. Whenever it is possible to do so, vegetables\\nshould be cooked in their skins, as there is much less waste of edible\\nmaterial if the skins are removed after cooking. Potatoes that are to be\\nfried, hashed brown, or used for salad and other similar dishes may be\\nboiled in their skins and peeled afterwards just as conveniently as to\\nbe peeled first and then boiled. Indeed, this plan is strongly\\nrecommended, for it not only saves material that is removed in the\\npeeling but also conserves the mineral salts and the soluble food\\nmaterial, much of which is lost in the water during the cooking.\\n\\n33. If it is desired to remove the peeling before cooking, it will be\\nfound more economical to put the vegetables in water and then scrape off\\nthe skins than to cut them off with a knife. This method is especially\\nsatisfactory with new potatoes and with such vegetables as carrots,\\nparsnips, salsify, and turnips. The scraping can be accomplished more\\neasily if the vegetables are first plunged into boiling water for a few\\nminutes and then dipped into cold water.\\n\\nWhen entire heads of such vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels\\nsprouts, etc. are to be cooked, they should be soaked, head down, for at\\nleast 1/2 hour in salted water made by adding 1 teaspoon-full of salt to\\n1 quart of water. This is done in order to remove any bugs or worms that\\nmay be lodged in the head. The correct proportion of salt is an\\nimportant detail of this process, for if salt water that is too strong\\nis used, it will kill the bugs or worms and they will remain in the\\nhead.  34. METHODS OF COOKING APPLIED TO VEGETABLES.--The usual methods\\nof cooking applied to vegetables are boiling, steaming, baking, stewing,\\nfrying, saut\\u00e9ing, broiling, and roasting. Which one of these to select\\ndepends, of course, on the particular kind of vegetable that is to be\\ncooked and the result that is desired, but, if possible, an effort\\nshould be made to select an economical method. Starchy vegetables, such\\nas Irish and sweet potatoes, beans, etc., develop a more delicious\\nflavor when they are baked than when they are cooked by any other method\\nof preparation. Steaming is an excellent means of preparing vegetables\\nthat must be cooked by moist heat, especially when it is desired that no\\nsoluble material be lost, as is often the case in boiling. Frying and\\nsaut\\u00e9ing, when applied to vegetables, usually produce a delicious\\nflavor, but often render the vegetables decidedly indigestible. For this\\nreason, vegetables so prepared should seldom if ever be served to\\nchildren and to persons whose digestion is not good.\\n\\n35. EFFECT OF COOKING ON VEGETABLES.--The various ways in which cooking\\naffects vegetables should be thoroughly understood by the housewife. In\\nthe first place, some methods conserve the food material whereas others\\nwaste it. For instance, boiling in water, which is probably one of the\\nmost common ways of cooking vegetables, is decidedly advantageous in\\nsome respects, but the water dissolves much of the soluble material,\\nsuch as mineral salts, sugar, etc., found in the vegetables, so that\\nunless some use is made of this water in the cooking of other foods,\\nconsiderable waste results. On the other hand, steaming and baking\\npermit no loss of food material, and so they should be applied to\\nvegetables whenever it is desired to conserve food substances.\\n\\n36. The flavors of vegetables are greatly changed during the process of\\ncooking, being increased in some cases and decreased in others. In the\\ncase of such strongly flavored vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower,\\nonions, etc., it is advisable to dissipate part of the flavor. Therefore\\nsuch vegetables should be cooked in an open vessel in order that the\\nflavor may be decreased by evaporation. Vegetables mild in flavor,\\nhowever, are improved by being cooked in a closed vessel, for all their\\nflavor should be retained. The overcooking of vegetables is sometimes\\nresponsible for an increase of a disagreeable flavor.  37. Another\\nfeature of vegetables often changed by cooking is their color. For\\ninstance, green vegetables do not, upon cooking, always remain green. In\\nmany cases, the color may be improved by adding a very small quantity of\\nsoda to the water in which the vegetables are cooked. Attention should\\nalso be given to the length of time vegetables are subjected to heat,\\nfor the overboiling of some vegetables is liable to develop an\\nunattractive color in them. This is particularly the case with cabbage,\\ncauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, which develop not only a strong,\\ndisagreeable flavor but also a reddish color when cooked too long.\\n\\n38. The application of heat to vegetables also has a definite effect on\\nthem. By sufficient cooking, the cellulose of vegetables is softened to\\nthe extent that it is less irritating and much more likely to be partly\\ndigested than that of raw vegetables. The acids of fruits increase upon\\ncooking, and so the acidity of vegetables is increased to a certain\\nextent. Vegetables that contain starch are rendered digestible in no\\nother way than by cooking. On the other hand, the protein material of\\nthis food is coagulated by the application of heat, just as the white of\\nan egg or the tissue of meat is coagulated and hardened. However,\\ncooking is the only means of softening the cellulose that surrounds\\nthis material.\\n\\nStill, high-protein foods, such as beans, peas, and lentils, can be much\\nimproved if they are cooked in water that is not very hard. The lime in\\nhard water has a tendency to harden them to the extent that they require\\na much longer time to cook than when soft water is used. These\\nvegetables may be still further softened by the addition of a small\\nquantity of soda to the water in which they are cooked, but care should\\nbe taken not to use too much soda, as it will injure the flavor. When\\nsoda is used, the vegetable should be parboiled for 10 or 15 minutes in\\nthe soda water and then drained and cooked in fresh water. This method,\\nof course, does not apply to vegetables that are cooked in soda water to\\nretain their color.\\n\\n39. Salt is always added in the cooking of vegetables to season them. In\\nthe use of salt, two important points must be borne in mind: first, that\\nit has the effect of hardening the tissues of the vegetable in much the\\nsame manner as it hardens the tissues of meat; and, secondly, that it\\nhelps to draw out the flavor of the vegetables. These two facts\\ndetermine largely the time for adding the salt. If an old, tough,\\nwinter vegetable is to be prepared, it should be cooked until nearly\\nsoft in water that contains no salt, and the salt should be added just\\nbefore the cooking is finished. When it is desired to draw out the\\nflavor, as, for instance, when vegetables are cooked for soup or stews,\\nthe salt should be supplied when the vegetables are put on to cook.\\nYoung tender vegetables may be cooked in salt water, but as such water\\nextracts a certain amount of flavor, an effort should be made to use it\\nin the preparation of stews, sauces, and soups.\\n\\n\\nSAUCES FOR VEGETABLES\\n\\n40. Vegetables may, of course, be served plain, but they are greatly\\nimproved in flavor, nutritive value, and often in appearance by the\\naddition of a well-seasoned sauce. Numerous sauces are used for this\\npurpose, the one to select depending somewhat on the vegetable, the\\nmethod of cooking employed, and the flavor that is desired. Recipes for\\nthe sauces found to be most satisfactory are here given. It will be well\\nto practice the making of these, so as to become familiar with them and\\nthus know just what sauce is meant when reference is made to a\\nparticular sauce in the recipes for vegetables. The quantities given in\\nthe recipes for sauces will make sufficient sauce to dress the\\nvegetables required for four to six persons. White sauce, which is\\nprobably the one that is used oftenest, may be made in various\\nthicknesses, as has been explained previously. However, the medium white\\nsauce has been found to be the one most nearly correct for vegetables\\nand consequently the one most preferred.\\n\\nMEDIUM WHITE SAUCE\\n\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n\\nMelt the butter and add the flour, salt, and pepper.

Allow the sauce to become hot, but not to\\nboil. This is an excellent sauce to use over new potatoes or diced\\nvegetables, such as turnips or carrots.\\n\\n\\nASPARAGUS AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n41. ASPARAGUS is a vegetable that consists of the shoots of the plant,\\nwhich are eaten before the blossoms develop. It grows quickly and is\\nvery tender if the shoots are clipped at just the right time after they\\nappear above the ground. It comes early in the spring, being about the\\nfirst green vegetable that gets into the local market, but its season is\\ncomparatively short. It does not keep long after it is purchased and is\\nbetter when it is used at once. If asparagus must be kept for any length\\nof time, it should be stored in a cool, damp place.\\n\\n42. In selecting asparagus, it should be remembered that there are two\\nvarieties, one of which is green and the other white. The stems of the\\ngreen asparagus should be green to the bottom, and should not be hard\\nnor woody where they are cut from the plant. However, if a part of the\\nstems is found to be woody, the hard ends should not be rejected, for\\nthe outside may be peeled off and the center used, or the hard ends may\\nbe cooked with other vegetables for the making of soup. The white\\nasparagus will have slightly green tips, while the rest of the stem\\nwill be white.\\n\\nAsparagus is one of the succulent vegetables comparatively low in food\\nvalue. It contains, as Table I shows, only one-fourth as many calories\\nto the pound as potatoes. Its food value, however, may be increased by\\ndressing it with butter after the vegetable has been cooked or by\\nserving with it a sauce made with milk, butter, flour, etc. Then, too,\\nasparagus is sometimes served on toast, which is another means of making\\na more nutritious dish out of this vegetable.\\n\\nIn its composition, asparagus contains a _diuretic_, that is, a\\nsubstance that has an effect upon the kidneys, and that is known as\\n_asparagine_. Because of the presence of this substance, asparagus is\\nthought to be injurious to those who have kidney trouble, but it need\\nnot be avoided except in some forms of this disease.  43. PREPARATION\\nFOR COOKING.--To prepare asparagus for cooking, strip the tiny scales\\nfrom the sides of the stems by means of a small paring knife. These hold\\nsand and are responsible for the presence of the grit that is sometimes\\nfound in a cooked dish of asparagus even when the housewife feels\\ncertain that she has washed it as clean as possible. Then wash the stems\\nthoroughly in several cold waters, lifting them out of the water after\\neach washing instead of pouring the water off of them. If the water is\\npoured off the stems, the sand that has been washed from them is likely\\nto remain in the bottom of the pan and mix with the vegetable again.\\n\\nWhen the asparagus has been sufficiently washed, it may be used in the\\nfull lengths or cut into pieces of any desired length, 1 inch being the\\nsize that is usually preferred. If stems are to be cooked whole, it is a\\ngood plan to form them into a bunch as when purchased and tie the bunch\\nwith a tape or a string. When this is done, the string should, of\\ncourse, be cut and removed before the asparagus is served. A point to\\nremember about the preparation of this vegetable is that it should\\nalways be cooked in boiling, salted water.\\n\\n44. ASPARAGUS WITH BUTTER DRESSING.--Perhaps the simplest way in which\\nto prepare asparagus is to cook it in salted water and then serve it\\nwith a butter dressing. When prepared in this way, it may be served\\nplain, but it becomes more attractive, as well as more nutritious, if it\\nis placed on squares of toast.\\n\\nFor this dish, secure a bunch of fresh, tender asparagus, wash it\\nthoroughly, and then, as desired, cut it into inch lengths or allow it\\nto remain whole. Pour enough boiling water over it to cover well, add\\nsalt in the proportion of 1 teaspoonful to each quart of water, and\\nallow it to cook until the stems may be easily pierced with a fork,\\nwhich in most cases will require not more than from 10 to 15 minutes.\\nThe length of the cooking is an important factor with this vegetable,\\nfor when it is overcooked its flavor is not so agreeable as when it has\\nhad just enough cooking. When the asparagus is done, drain off the\\nwater, season with a little more salt and a dash of pepper, and, if it\\nis to be served without toast, add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each\\nbunch cooked, allowing the butter to melt. In case it is to be served on\\ntoast, allow a small amount of the liquid in which it was cooked to\\nremain on it, add the butter to this, and, after placing several of the\\nstems or a number of the pieces on the squares of toast, dip a little of\\nthe liquid over all.  45. CREAMED ASPARAGUS ON TOAST.--A still more\\nnutritious dish can be prepared from asparagus by combining it with a\\ncream sauce and serving it on toast. The sauce supplies protein and fat\\nand the toast furnishes carbohydrate, substances in which this vegetable\\nis low. Numerous ways of serving this combination may be resorted to,\\nbut one of the most attractive methods is illustrated in Fig. 2. As here\\nshown, a small bunch of the stems is slipped through a ring of toast cut\\nby means of round cutters of two sizes. If it is not desired to use\\ntoast for this, a ring of lemon rind or pimiento may be substituted, or\\nthe ring may be omitted altogether and the stems merely laid in an\\norderly manner on a square of toast. Also, with this dish, as with the\\nprevious one, the asparagus may be cut into inch lengths instead of\\nbeing cooked whole.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\\n\\nTo prepare creamed asparagus, clean it in the manner explained in Art.\\n43. Then either cut it into inch lengths or allow the stems to remain\\nwhole, and cook it in enough boiling salted water to cover it well.\\nWhile the asparagus is cooking, prepare a medium white sauce. As soon as\\nthe asparagus has cooked enough to be pierced with a fork, pour off the\\nwater and serve with the sauce in any of the ways already suggested. If\\nthe asparagus is left whole, the sauce is poured over it after it is\\nplaced on the toast, but when it is cut into small pieces, it is usually\\ncombined with the sauce and the creamed vegetable then poured over\\nthe toast.\\n\\n46. SCALLOPED ASPARAGUS.--Another nutritious dish with asparagus as its\\nbase is scalloped asparagus. This involves all the ingredients used in\\ncreamed asparagus, but to give it still more food value, cheese is\\nalso added.\\n\\nSCALLOPED ASPARAGUS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 bunch asparagus\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 c. asparagus stock\\n1/2 c. milk\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\n1 c. buttered cracker crumbs\\n1/2 c. grated cheese\\n\\nClean the asparagus according to the directions given in Art. 43. Cut\\nit into inch lengths and cook in boiling salted water until it is tender\\nenough to be pierced with a fork, and then drain. Prepare a sauce by\\nmelting the butter, adding the flour, and pouring into this mixture the\\nheated stock and milk seasoned with the salt. Put a layer of the\\nbuttered crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish, and pour half the\\nasparagus over them. Sprinkle the asparagus with one-third the cheese\\nand add another layer of crumbs. Sprinkle this with one-third the\\ncheese. Add the remainder of the asparagus and the crumbs and sprinkle\\nthe rest of the cheese on top. Pour the sauce over the entire mixture,\\nplace in the oven, and bake until heated thoroughly and the top is\\nslightly browned. Serve from the baking dish.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBEANS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\nVARIETIES OF BEANS\\n\\n47. Of all the vegetables commonly used for food, BEANS afford the\\ngreatest variety. However, there are two principal classes into which\\nall varieties of this vegetable can be placed, namely, _string beans_\\nand _shell beans_. String beans include both the pods and the seeds, and\\nare used when the beans are very young. Shell beans consist of the\\nseeds, which are allowed to mature either partly or entirely and are\\ntaken from the shells before cooking. Those which are partly developed\\nare cooked when they are fresh, but the ones that are allowed to mature\\ncompletely are dried and then stored for use at any time during the\\nyear. In some cases, the same variety of beans may be used in the three\\nways mentioned, while in others certain kinds are raised expressly for\\none of these purposes.\\n\\n48. The food value of beans increases as they mature, as will be\\nobserved upon reference to Table I. The very young beans, that is, the\\nstring beans, which include the pods and all, are comparatively low in\\nfood value, being only a little higher than asparagus. To increase the\\nfood value of these, fat meat, butter, or other fat is supplied in their\\ncooking, or milk or a cream sauce is added before they are served. Fresh\\nshell beans have much more nutriment than string beans, whereas dried\\nbeans are very high in food value. It is this characteristic of dried\\nshell beans that makes them a very good meat substitute.\\n\\n STRING BEANS\\n\\n49. VARIETIES OF STRING BEANS.--There are two general varieties of\\nstring beans: the yellow ones, which are commonly known as _wax beans_,\\nand the green ones, which are the ones usually meant when the term\\nstring beans is used. Numerous varieties exist among these classes, and\\nsome are very much better than others. Many of them have strings, but\\nothers are stringless and consequently are easier to prepare. Whatever\\nkind is used should be picked from the vines before the beans are old\\nenough for the pods to develop woody fibers. Otherwise they will not be\\npalatable, for when they have reached this stage it will be impossible\\nto cook them soft.\\n\\n50. SELECTION AND CARE.--Small, round, rusty-looking spots are common to\\nboth string and wax beans; but when such spots are present they must be\\nremoved before cooking. As there is considerable waste in the\\npreparation of such beans for the table, it is wise in buying string\\nbeans to select those whose surface is not marred with such blemishes.\\nIn addition, the beans should be as fresh as can be obtained and crisp\\nand tender enough to snap when the pods are bent in half. Proper\\nattention should be given to them after they are purchased, too. If\\npossible, they should be cooked immediately, but if this cannot be done\\nthey should be kept in a cool, damp place to prevent them from becoming\\nlimp. However, if they wilt before they can be cooked, they may be\\nfreshened by allowing them to stand in cold water for a short time.\\n\\n51. PREPARATION AND COOKING.--To prepare beans for cooking, wash them\\nthoroughly in cold water. If the beans are of the stringless variety,\\ncut off the stem and blossom ends; but, in case they have strings, break\\nthe ends and strip off the strings together with the ends, as shown in\\nFig. 3. The beans may then be cooked whole or cut into inch lengths\\nbefore cooking. If it is desired to cut them, the most convenient way is\\nto place them in an orderly heap on a cutting board and then cut a\\nhandful at a time, drawing a sharp knife across them as they are held on\\nthe board. Any imperfect portions should be removed before cutting.\\n\\n52. The cooking of string beans is similar to that of asparagus, except\\nthat they require longer cooking. Put them, either whole or cut into a\\nkettle, cover them with boiling water to which has been added 1\\nteaspoonful of salt to each quart of water, and cook them with the cover\\non the kettle until they can be easily pierced with a fork. The length\\nof time required to cook them depends on the age of the beans, but\\nusually from 30 minutes to 1 hour will be sufficient. When they are\\ndone, drain the water from them, but save it to make sauce for them or\\nto add to soup stock.\\n\\n53. STRING BEANS IN BUTTER.--String beans, which, of course, include wax\\nbeans, may be served with a sauce of some kind, but they are very\\nappetizing when merely drained after cooking and served with\\nmelted butter.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\\n\\nTo prepare beans in this manner, wash the desired amount, remove the\\nends and strings, if necessary, and cut into inch lengths. Cook until\\nthey are tender and then pour off the water. Add 1 tablespoonful of\\nbutter for each four persons to be served, a dash of pepper, and, if\\nthey are not salty enough, a little more salt. Allow the butter to melt\\nand serve the beans hot.\\n\\n54. STRING BEANS WITH SALT PORK.--Those who like the flavor of salt pork\\nwill find string beans cooked with a small piece of this meat very\\nappetizing. Besides improving the flavor, salt pork supplies the beans\\nwith fat, a food substance in which they are very low.\\n\\nAfter washing the beans that are to be cooked in this way, remove the\\nends and strings, but do not cut into inch lengths. Put the whole beans\\nto cook in boiling water and add 1/4 pound of pork for a sufficient\\namount of beans for four persons. Cook until the beans are tender, and\\nserve with the pork without removing from the liquid.\\n\\n55. CREAMED STRING BEANS.--Perhaps the most popular way in which to\\nprepare string or wax beans is to cream them. Not only an appetizing\\ndish, but one whose food value is increased, is the result. The cream\\nsauce served with the beans may be made entirely of milk, but a very\\nsatisfactory sauce can be made by using half milk or cream and half\\nliquid in which the beans were cooked. To prepare creamed beans, clean\\nthe beans in the usual way and cut them into inch lengths. Put them to\\ncook in boiling salted water and cook until they may be easily pierced\\nwith a fork. Pour off the water, but keep it to use in the dressing. To\\ndress a sufficient quantity of beans for four persons, a sauce should be\\nmade as follows:\\n\\nSAUCE FOR CREAMED STRING BEANS\\n\\n1 Tb. butter\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1/4 tsp. salt\\nPinch of pepper\\n1/3 c. rich milk or cream\\n1/3 c. liquid from beans\\n\\nMelt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Pour\\nin the heated liquids and stir until the mixture is smooth and\\nthoroughly cooked. Add the sauce to the beans, heat together, and serve.\\n\\n56. STRING BEANS WITH SOUR DRESSING.--A dish having an entirely\\ndifferent flavor from those already explained is produced when beans are\\nserved with a sour dressing.\\n\\nTo prepare beans in this way, clean a sufficient number according to the\\ndirections already given and cut them into inch lengths. Cook them in\\nboiling salted water until they are tender. Pour off the water, but\\nretain 1/2 cupful for the dressing. Make the following sauce, which will\\ndress a sufficient quantity of beans for four persons:\\n\\nSOUR DRESSING\\n\\n2 Tb. ham or bacon fat\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1/4 c. vinegar\\n1/2 c. liquid from beans\\n\\nMelt the fat in a double boiler, add the flour, and into this stir the\\nvinegar and the liquid from the beans. Cook until the mixture thickens\\nand pour over the beans. Reheat and serve.\\n\\n\\nSHELL BEANS\\n\\n57. VARIETIES AND FOOD VALUE OF SHELL BEANS.--When beans have matured on\\nthe vines to such an extent that the pods are no longer tender enough\\nfor human consumption, they are picked and the seeds then used for food.\\nSome are picked before the seeds have entirely matured, and these, which\\nmust be young enough to contain considerable moisture, are cooked\\nfresh; others are allowed to mature entirely and are then dried before\\nthey are cooked. After being dried, beans keep indefinitely and require\\nno care in storage except that they must not become moist. Numerous\\nvarieties of both fresh and dried shell beans are in use, including\\nnavy, marrowfat, pinto, and Lima beans.\\n\\n58. Fresh shell beans average about three times as much food value as\\nstring or wax beans. Most of this is carbohydrate in the form of starch,\\nbut they also contain considerable protein. Dried shell beans, which are\\nentirely different in flavor and texture from fresh ones, contain still\\nmore nutriment, their food value being more than twice that of fresh\\nshell beans and over four times that of potatoes. In the entirely\\nmatured bean, which, as has already been mentioned, belongs to the class\\nof vegetables called legumes, the high food value is due to the high\\npercentage of starch and the large amount of protein in the form of\\nlegumin, a substance that is an important substitute for other more\\nexpensive protein foods. This composition reveals at once the fact that\\ndried shell beans make an excellent food, provided some fat is added to\\nthem in their preparation.\\n\\n59. PREPARATION AND COOKING OF FRESH SHELL BEANS.--With the exception of\\nLima beans, most of the varieties of fresh shell beans are placed on the\\nmarket in the pods and must be shelled after they are purchased. Green\\nLima beans, however, are usually sold shelled. If the beans are\\npurchased in the pods, wash them in cold water before shelling, but if\\nthey are bought shelled, wash the shelled beans. Then put them to cook\\nin sufficient boiling water to which has been added 1 teaspoonful of\\nsalt for each quart. Allow the beans to cook until they may be easily\\npierced with a fork. The cooking will probably require from 45 minutes\\nto 1-1/2 hours, depending on the age and variety of the beans.\\n\\n60. SHELL BEANS DRESSED WITH BUTTER.--Any variety of fresh shell beans\\nmay be prepared according to the accompanying recipe, but Lima beans are\\nespecially delicious when cooked in this way.\\n\\nPrepare and cook the beans as directed in Art. 59. When they are\\nsufficiently cooked, pour off the water, season with additional salt, if\\nnecessary, and a dash of pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for\\neach four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt and serve the\\nbeans hot.  61. SHELL BEANS IN CREAM.--Fresh shell beans are especially\\nappetizing when they are dressed with cream. Besides improving the\\nflavor, cream also adds considerable food value, an item that should not\\nbe overlooked.\\n\\nFor this dish, prepare and cook the beans in the manner explained in\\nArt. 59. When they are tender, pour off the water and season with\\nadditional salt and pepper. Then for each four persons to be served, add\\n1 tablespoonful of butter and 1/2 cupful of thin cream. Heat the beans\\nwell in the cream and serve.\\n\\n62. BEAN PUR\\u00c9E.--Persons with whom the coarse skins that must\\nnecessarily be eaten with beans disagree, find bean pur\\u00e9e very\\nsatisfactory. To prepare it, clean and cook the beans in boiling salted\\nwater according to the directions given in Art. 59. Then pour off the\\nwater and force the beans through a ricer or a sieve. Add sufficient\\nbutter, salt, and pepper to season well and serve hot.\\n\\n63. COOKING OF DRIED SHELL BEANS.--Before dried shell beans of any\\nvariety are cooked, look them over very carefully, reject any that are\\nunfit for use, and wash the rest in cold water. They may then be cooked\\nwithout further preparation, but in order to hasten their cooking and\\nsave fuel in their preparation, it is a good plan to moisten them by\\nsoaking them in water before cooking. If they are to be soaked, place\\nthem in cold water and allow them to remain there for 8 to 12 hours.\\nThen put them on to cook in water to which has been added a small pinch\\nof soda. Parboil the beans in this water until the outside skin begins\\nto crack and then pour off the water. While it is true that a certain\\namount of mineral salts and perhaps a small percentage of food value are\\nlost in this procedure, because the water that is poured off is too\\nstrong to be used for any other purpose, the improvement in the flavor\\nwarrants any loss that might occur. After pouring off the water, wash\\nthe beans in cold water, add fresh water to continue the cooking, and\\nallow the beans to simmer slowly until they are cooked soft enough to\\ncrush between the fingers, but still retain their original shape.\\nNothing is gained by cooking them rapidly on a hot fire, and\\nconsiderable fuel is wasted by this practice.\\n\\nThe fireless cooker and the double boiler are excellent utensils for the\\ncooking of dried beans, because they cook the beans at a temperature\\nbelow boiling point. They therefore cook the beans soft with little\\ndifficulty and prevent the protein from becoming hard. The theory of the\\ncooking of protein--that is, the higher the temperature, the harder the\\ncoagulation--applies in the cooking of dried beans, just as it does in\\nthe cooking of eggs or milk.\\n\\n64. STEWED NAVY BEANS.--The common small white beans are called _navy\\nbeans_ from the fact that they are much used in the navy. These may be\\nprepared in various ways, but the simplest method is to stew them. In\\nthe preparation of this dish, as well as any other made from dried\\nbeans, it will be well to remember that 1/2 cupful of beans is usually\\nsufficient to serve four persons when they are cooked.\\n\\nLook over the required amount of beans, reject any that are imperfect,\\nwash thoroughly, and put to soak overnight in cold water. Pour off any\\nwater that remains, cover well with boiling water, and add a pinch of\\nsoda. Cook slowly until the skins begin to burst. Pour off the water,\\nadd fresh hot water and 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water,\\nand allow to simmer until the beans may be easily crushed between the\\nfingers. During this process, the water should cook down until just a\\nsufficient amount to serve with the beans remains. When this is\\naccomplished, add 1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of butter, a dash of pepper, and,\\nif necessary, additional salt. Instead of the butter, ham or bacon fat\\nmay be used for seasoning, or a small piece of ham or salt pork may be\\ncooked with the beans and the fat omitted. Serve the beans hot.\\n\\n65. LIMA BEANS IN CREAM.--Dried Lima beans, when combined with thin\\ncream, make a very appetizing dish. To prepare them in this way, clean,\\nsoak, and cook them as explained in Art. 63. When they are soft enough\\nto crush easily between the fingers and the water has boiled down so\\nthat practically none remains, add 1/2 cupful of thin cream to a\\nsufficient quantity for four persons. Allow the beans to simmer for a\\nshort time in the cream, add additional salt and a dash of pepper for\\nflavoring, and serve.\\n\\n66. LIMA BEANS EN CASSEROLE.--While the small varieties of dried beans\\nare more commonly baked than the larger ones, Lima beans will be found\\nespecially delicious when prepared in a casserole.\\n\\nLIMA BEANS EN CASSEROLE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. dried Lima beans\\n1/4 c. ham or bacon fat\\n2 c. milk\\n2 tsp. salt\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\n\\nSoak the beans overnight and then parboil them in soda water. Drain off\\nthe water and turn the beans into a baking dish. Add the fat, milk,\\nsalt, and pepper. Cover the dish and bake until the beans are soft.\\nServe hot from the casserole.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\\n\\n67. LIMA-BEAN LOAF.--If a dish that is not only appetizing, but\\nsufficient in food value to be used as a meat substitute, is desired,\\nLima-bean loaf, which is illustrated in Fig. 4, should be selected. This\\nis very good when served alone, but it becomes more attractive and at\\nthe same time more palatable when a sauce or gravy is added.\\n\\nLIMA-BEAN LOAF\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. dried Lima beans\\n2 c. bread crumbs\\nMilk to moisten crumbs\\n2 eggs\\n1 tsp. salt\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\n1/2 tsp. celery salt\\n2 Tb. butter\\n\\nSoak the beans overnight and parboil them in soda water. Pour off this\\nwater, cook until tender in boiling salted water, and then drain.\\nMoisten the bread crumbs slightly with milk, mix them with the beans,\\nand add the beaten eggs and seasoning. When the entire mixture is well\\nblended, place in a loaf pan, dot the top with the butter, and bake in\\nthe oven until nicely browned and quite firm. Turn out on a platter,\\ngarnish with parsley, and serve by cutting it into slices, as shown\\nin Fig. 4.\\n\\n68. BEAN SOUFFL\\u00c9.--Probably the daintiest dish that can be made from\\ndried beans is bean souffl\\u00e9. This is equally suitable as the main dish\\nfor a luncheon or a home dinner. One point to remember about it is that\\nit should be served immediately, for souffl\\u00e9 usually settles when taken\\nfrom the oven.\\n\\nBEAN SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. bean pulp\\n1 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1/4 tsp. celery salt\\n1 Tb. onion juice\\n2 eggs\\n\\nMake the bean pulp by forcing well-cooked beans through a colander or a\\npress. Add all the seasoning and the beaten egg yolks. Beat the egg\\nwhites stiff and fold them into the mixture. When well blended, pour\\ninto a greased baking dish, or individual dishes, place in a pan\\ncontaining hot water, and bake in a moderate oven until the souffl\\u00e9 is\\nset, which will require from 30 to 45 minutes. Test by tapping slightly\\nwith the finger. If the dent thus made in the souffl\\u00e9 springs back, it\\nis sufficiently baked. Remove from the oven and serve at once.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\\n\\n69. BAKED BEANS.--Almost any kind of dried beans may be used for baking.\\nSome persons prefer the small navy beans, which are mentioned in this\\nrecipe, whereas others like the larger marrowfat beans or Lima beans.\\nPinto beans have for some time been taking the place of navy beans, and\\nare found to be a very good substitute. To bake beans successfully, a\\ndish with a tight-fitting cover, such as the one shown in Fig. 5, is\\nrequired. This is made of heavy glass, but if such a utensil is not\\navailable, very satisfactory results can be obtained by using a heavy\\nearthen bowl, crock, or baking dish. To produce the delicious flavor\\nthat is agreeable to most persons, beans should be baked a long time.\\nTherefore, as considerable heat is consumed in their cooking, it is a\\nwise plan to prepare more than enough for one meal. They may be served\\nthe second time as baked beans, or, if this is not desired, they may be\\nused for various other purposes.\\n\\nBAKED BEANS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 pt. navy beans\\n2 Tb. molasses\\n2 tsp. salt\\n1/2 lb. bacon or salt pork\\n\\nSoak the beans overnight, parboil in soda water, and drain. Add a\\nsufficient amount of water to cover the beans well, cook until they\\nbreak open, and then pour with the liquid into a baking dish. If this\\nliquid does not almost cover the beans, add more until it comes nearly\\nto the top. Add the molasses and salt, cut the salt pork into pieces,\\nand distribute these well through the beans, placing a piece or two over\\nthe top. The beans should then appear as shown in Fig. 5. Place the\\ncover on the dish and bake in a slow oven for 4 or 5 hours. Remove the\\ncover occasionally, stir the beans carefully so as not to crush nor\\nbreak them, and add enough water from time to time to keep the beans\\nwell moistened. When done, the beans should be light brown in color, but\\nthe top should be well browned. Sometimes it will be found necessary to\\nremove the cover in order to brown the beans sufficiently.\\n\\n70. BEAN CROQUETTES.--Left-over baked beans need never be wasted, for\\nthere are numerous uses to which they can be put. If it is not desired\\nto reheat them and serve them again as baked beans, they may be utilized\\nin soup, salads, and sandwiches, or they may be made into souffl\\u00e9, as\\nexplained in Art. 68, or into croquettes according to the accompanying\\nrecipe. Bean croquettes may be served plain, but they are much improved\\nby the addition of tomato sauce.\\n\\nBEAN CROQUETTES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. cold baked beans\\n1-1/2 c. bread crumbs\\nMilk to moisten crumbs\\n1 egg\\n1 tsp. salt\\nPinch of pepper\\n\\nTo the beans add the bread crumbs slightly moistened with milk. Stir in\\nthe egg, beaten, and the salt and pepper. Blend the entire mixture, form\\ninto croquettes, and roll in dry crumbs. Bake in the oven until brown,\\nsaut\\u00e9 in shallow fat, or fry in deep fat. Place on a platter, garnish\\nwith parsley, and serve plain or with tomato sauce.\\n\\n BEETS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n71. BEETS are a root vegetable that comes in two varieties, _red_ and\\n_white_. The red beets are more popular for cooking than the white ones,\\nand of these the ones that retain their dark-red color after cooking are\\npreferable to any other. The root, however, is not the only part of this\\nplant that is eaten, for the tops are also much used for food. When the\\ntops are to be cooked, the plants are usually not allowed to mature to\\nthe extent that the root parts can be used; still, early in the summer,\\nwhen very small beets are to be had with the tops on, both the tops and\\nthe beets may be used. At this age, the beets are very tender and do not\\nrequire long cooking. If the beets are not eaten when they are young,\\nthey are allowed to mature in the ground and are then pulled in the fall\\nand stored for a winter vegetable.\\n\\nLike other root vegetables, beets contain very little protein and fat,\\nbut in their composition is included a fairly large percentage of\\ncarbohydrate in the form of sugar. Their total food value is greater\\nthan that of string beans, but is considerably less than that\\nof potatoes.\\n\\n72. SELECTION AND CARE OF BEETS.--When beets are selected as a summer\\nvegetable with the idea of using both the tops and the roots, the tops\\nshould be fresh, that is, not withered nor rotted. When the roots are to\\nbe used, either as a summer or a winter vegetable, they should have a\\nsmooth skin, should contain no blemishes, and, as nearly as possible,\\nshould be uniform in size.\\n\\nSummer beets require about the same care as any other vegetable; that\\nis, they should be kept in a cool, damp place until they are ready to be\\ncooked. If they are at all wilted at that time, they may be freshened by\\nallowing them to stand in a pan of cold water for several hours. Winter\\nbeets, however, should be stored in a cool, dark place where they will\\nnot freeze. A portion of the cellar that has a dirt floor is a very good\\nplace to put the bins containing such vegetables. The woody tissue of\\nbeets that are stored increases as the winter advances, so that any\\nbeets that remain until spring are rather hard and extremely difficult\\nto cook. In fact, at times it is almost impossible to make them soft\\nenough to serve, but they can be greatly improved by soaking them in\\ncold water for a few hours before cooking them.  73. PREPARATION AND\\nCOOKING OF BEETS.--In preparing young beets for cooking, allow an inch\\nor two of the stems to remain on the beets in order to prevent them from\\nbleeding. Of course, from winter beets, the entire stem should be\\nremoved, as it will be dried up. Scrub beets of either variety carefully\\nwith a vegetable brush until entirely free from dirt. Then, whether they\\nare old or young, put them to cook in boiling water without removing\\ntheir skins. Allow them to cook until they are soft enough to be pierced\\nwith a fork. This is the best way in which to determine when the beets\\nare done, for as the length of time required to cook them depends\\nentirely on their age, no definite time can be stated. As soon as they\\nare sufficiently cooked, pour off the water, allow them to cool enough\\nto handle, and then remove the skins, which will slip off easily.\\n\\n74. BUTTERED BEETS.--Butter added to beets increases both their\\nnutriment and their flavor. In order to prepare buttered beets, first\\nclean and cook them in the manner just explained. To remove the skins,\\nscrape the beets as thinly as possible, so as not to waste any more than\\nis necessary. Then slice them thin or cut them into 1/2-inch cubes,\\nseason well with salt and pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for\\neach four persons to be served. Allow the beets to heat thoroughly in\\nthe butter, and serve hot.\\n\\n75. BEETS WITH CREAM DRESSING.--If a creamed vegetable is desired, beets\\nto which cream has been added will be very satisfactory. Clean and cook\\nthe beets in the manner explained in Art. 73. Then peel, cut into\\nslices, place in a saucepan, and nearly cover with thin cream. Allow\\nthem to cook in the cream for a few minutes, season with salt and\\npepper, and serve.\\n\\n76. BEETS WITH SOUR DRESSING.--To give variety, beets are sometimes\\nserved with a sour dressing. Probably no other vegetable lends itself so\\nwell to this sort of preparation as beets, with the result that a very\\nappetizing dish is provided.\\n\\nBEETS WITH SOUR DRESSING\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 medium-sized beets\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1/4 c. vinegar\\n1-1/4 c. hot water\\n\\nPrepare and cook the beets as explained in Art. 73. When tender, drain\\nthem, remove the skins, and dice the beets. Make a sauce by melting the\\nbutter in a double boiler and adding the flour, salt, pepper, vinegar,\\nand hot water. Cook until the flour thickens the sauce and then pour\\nover the beets. Heat together and serve.\\n\\n77. BAKED BEETS.--If something entirely different in the way of a\\nvegetable dish is wanted, baked beets will meet with favor. Beets may be\\nbaked in a covered baking dish or on the open grate of an oven. A slow\\nfire produces the best results, and as a rule it will take 4 or 5 hours\\nto bake good-sized beets.\\n\\nWash thoroughly and dry the desired number of beets. Place them in a\\nbaking dish and set in a slow oven or place them on the open grate. Bake\\nuntil they may be pierced with a fork. Remove from the skins and serve\\nwith a sour sauce or merely with salt, pepper, and butter.\\n\\n78. PICKLED BEETS.--When beets are cooked for any of the recipes that\\nhave been given, it will be economy to boil more than will be needed for\\none meal, for a large number can be cooked with practically the same\\nquantity of fuel as a few. Then the remainder may be pickled by peeling\\nthem, cutting them into slices, and pouring over them hot vinegar\\nsweetened slightly and flavored with spice. Pickled beets make an\\nexcellent relish and they will keep for an indefinite period.\\n\\n\\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\\n\\n79. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, as shown in Fig. 6, look just like tiny green\\nheads of cabbage. These heads grow along a stem that protrudes above the\\nsurface of the ground in much the same way as does the stem to which a\\nhead of cabbage is attached. The heads are cut from the stem and then\\nusually packed in quart boxes. It is in such boxes as these that they\\nare found in the markets, where they can be purchased from December\\nuntil early spring. They are considered a great delicacy because of the\\nfineness of their flavor, which rivals that of cauliflower and, while\\nclosely resembling that of cabbage, is much superior to it. In food\\nvalue, they are somewhat higher than cauliflower, but about equal\\nto beets.\\n\\n80. COOKING OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--To prepare Brussels sprouts for the\\ntable, break off the outside leaves from the heads, and then in order to\\nremove any bugs that may be lodged in the heads, allow them to stand in\\ncold salted water for 1 hour or so before cooking. After removing the\\nsprouts from the salted water, pour enough boiling water over them to\\ncover them well, add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water, and\\nboil without any cover on the kettle until they can be easily pierced\\nwith a fork. Care should be taken not to overcook the sprouts, for when\\nthey are cooked too long they become red in color and develop a\\nstrong flavor.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\\n\\n81. BUTTERED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--When Brussels sprouts are properly\\ncooked and then seasoned with salt and pepper and flavored with butter,\\nan appetizing dish is the result. To make such a dish for about six\\npersons, prepare and cook 1 quart of Brussels sprouts in the manner just\\nexplained. When they are tender, pour off the water, season with\\nadditional salt and a dash of pepper, and add 2 tablespoonfuls of\\nbutter. Allow the butter to melt over the sprouts and then serve hot.\\n\\nIf a more attractive dish is desired, the Brussels sprouts prepared in\\nthis way may be combined with French lamb chops, as shown in Fig. 7.\\nPile up the buttered sprouts in the center of a platter, and then place\\nbroiled or saut\\u00e9d lamb chops, whose ends are trimmed with paper frills,\\naround the sprouts in the manner shown.  82. CREAMED BRUSSELS\\nSPROUTS.--A very satisfactory way in which to prepare Brussels sprouts\\nis to serve a cream sauce over them. This sauce, of course, adds food\\nvalue, and at the same time greatly improves the flavor of the\\nvegetable.\\n\\nCREAMED BRUSSELS SPROUTS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 qt. Brussels sprouts\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1-1/2 c. milk\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nPrepare and cook the sprouts as explained in Art. 80. When they are\\ntender, drain the water from them. Make a white sauce of the butter,\\nflour, milk, salt, and pepper. Pour this over the sprouts, heat\\ntogether, and serve.\\n\\n83. SCALLOPED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--Undoubtedly the most palatable way of\\npreparing Brussels sprouts is to scallop them. The ingredients used in\\nthe preparation of this dish add food value, as well as flavor.\\n\\nSCALLOPED BRUSSELS SPROUTS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 qt. Brussels sprouts\\n3 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 tsp. salt\\n2 c. milk\\n1 c. buttered crumbs\\n\\nPrepare the sprouts as explained in Art. 80. Cook them in boiling salted\\nwater until they are tender, and then drain. Make a white sauce of 2\\ntablespoonfuls of the butter, flour, salt, and milk. Butter the crumbs\\nby pouring 1 tablespoonful of melted butter over them, stirring until\\nwell blended. Place one-fourth of the crumbs in the bottom of a baking\\ndish, add about half of the sprouts, and place another fourth of the\\ncrumbs over the sprouts. Add the remaining half of the sprouts and pour\\nthe sauce over these. Sprinkle the rest of the crumbs over the top,\\nplace in the oven, and bake until the crumbs are brown and the\\ningredients thoroughly heated.\\n\\n\\nCABBAGE AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n84. CABBAGE consists of the foliage of the cabbage plant. It is a\\nsucculent vegetable with a high flavor; in fact, its flavor is so strong\\nthat in many cases it disagrees with persons. However, if cabbage is\\nproperly cooked, no apprehension need be felt about eating it, for it\\ncan be digested by most persons.  The food value of cabbage is not\\nhigh, being even less than that of string beans. The greater part of\\nthis food value is carbohydrate in the form of sugar, but in order to\\nprepare cabbage so that it has any importance in the meal, considerable\\nquantities of protein, fat, and carbohydrate must be added. In itself,\\nit is valuable for its mineral salts and bulk.\\n\\nNumerous varieties of cabbage can be procured, but only three are\\ncommonly used. These include _white cabbage_, which is used the most;\\n_purple cabbage_, which is very dark in color and contains varying\\nshades of red and blue; and _Savoy cabbage_, which has a large number of\\ngreen crinkled leaves and is commonly cooked by boiling.\\n\\n85. SELECTION AND CARE OF CABBAGE.--Heads of cabbage that feel firm and\\nsolid to the touch and are rather heavy for their size are the best to\\nselect for cooking purposes. This vegetable comes into the market early\\nin the summer and may be had until late in the fall. As it has excellent\\nkeeping qualities, it may be stored for use as a winter vegetable. When\\nthis is done, the stem and the roots should be allowed to remain on the\\nhead, for then the cabbage is less apt to wither. If this precaution is\\ntaken and the cabbage is stored in a cool place, no great care is\\nrequired to keep it in good condition until it is to be cooked unless,\\nof course, it is kept for an abnormal length of time.\\n\\n86. PREPARATION AND COOKING OF CABBAGE.--To prepare cabbage for cooking,\\nremove the outside leaves and then cut the head that remains into pieces\\nof any desirable size. Whether the cabbage should be left in large\\npieces or cut very fine depends on the dish that is to be prepared. For\\nthe first cutting, be sure to cut the head down through the heart and\\nthe stem, so that the part not used will remain intact. This may then be\\nused another time if it is kept cool and moist. In case the cabbage\\nbecomes at all wilted, it may be freshened by placing it in cold water a\\nshort time before it is to be cooked.\\n\\n87. Cabbage is a vegetable that has many uses and is eaten both raw and\\ncooked. Numerous opinions exist about the difference in digestibility\\nbetween raw and cooked cabbage, as well as the best ways in which to\\ncook this vegetable. It may be true that in some cases raw cabbage does\\nnot cause the disagreeable effect that cooked cabbage often does, but\\nthe reason for this is that cabbage when raw has a milder flavor than\\nwhen cooked, cabbage generally developing during the cooking a strong\\nflavor that causes trouble. The flavor of cabbage, however, may be\\ndissipated if attention is given to the cooking, so that, when properly\\nprepared, cabbage can be eaten with little fear of indigestion.\\n\\n88. When cabbage is cooked, it is usually boiled like other vegetables;\\nthat is, it is covered well with boiling water to which 1 teaspoonful of\\nsalt is added for each quart, and then allowed to boil until it can be\\neasily pierced with a fork. Its cooking differs, however, from that of\\nmany vegetables, string beans, for instance, in that it is carried on\\nwith the cover removed from the kettle. This plan permits of the\\nevaporation of much of the strong flavor, which arises in the steam and\\nwhich would otherwise be reabsorbed by the cabbage. Since it is the\\nretention of this flavor, together with long cooking, that causes this\\nvegetable to disagree with persons who eat it, both of these points\\nshould be carefully watched. If it is cooked in an open vessel and it is\\nboiled just long enough to be tender, so that when done it is white and\\nfresh-looking and not in any way discolored, an easily digested dish\\nwill be the result. Usually cabbage will cook sufficiently in 1/2 hour\\nand often in less time.\\n\\n89. BOILED CABBAGE.--Although cabbage permits of numerous methods of\\npreparation, plain boiled cabbage finds favor with many persons.\\nGenerally, cabbage prepared in this way is merely seasoned with butter\\nand served in a part of the liquid in which it is cooked, but it has a\\nmore appetizing flavor if bacon or ham fat is used for seasoning or if a\\nsmall quantity of ham or salt pork is cooked with it.\\n\\nTo prepare boiled cabbage, remove the outside leaves from a head of\\ncabbage, cut it in half down through the heart, and then cut each half\\ninto coarse pieces. Unless it is very fresh, allow it to stand in cold\\nwater for at least 1 hour before cooking. Put it into a kettle or a\\nsaucepan, cover well with boiling water, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt\\nfor each quart of water. If ham or salt pork is to be cooked with the\\ncabbage, put a small piece in the kettle with the cabbage. Allow the\\ncabbage to cook with the cover removed until it is sufficiently tender\\nto be pierced with a fork. Pour off all or a part of the liquid,\\ndepending on whether it is to be served dry or in its own liquid, and\\nthen, in case it has been cooked alone, add butter or ham or bacon fat\\nfor flavor. If not sufficiently seasoned, add pepper and more salt.\\n\\n90. CREAMED CABBAGE.--When cabbage is to be creamed, it is cut up into\\nfairly fine pieces with a sharp knife. The cream sauce that is added to\\nit provides considerable food value and greatly improves its flavor.\\n\\nCREAMED CABBAGE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n4 c. finely cut cabbage\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1/2 c. milk or thin cream\\n1/2 c. liquid from cabbage\\n\\nCook the cabbage according to the directions given in Art. 89 until it\\nis tender and then drain the water from it. While it is cooking, melt\\nthe butter in a double boiler, add the flour, and stir until smooth.\\nPour in the heated liquid and season with the salt and pepper. Stir\\nuntil the flour is thickened and the sauce is smooth. Pour this over the\\ncabbage, heat together for a few minutes, and serve hot.\\n\\n91. SCALLOPED CABBAGE.--Scalloped cabbage is a particularly appetizing\\nvegetable dish, and, on account of the ingredients used in its\\npreparation, it is more nutritious than some of the other dishes in\\nwhich cabbage is used.\\n\\nSCALLOPED CABBAGE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n4 c. cabbage\\n1 c. buttered crumbs\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n1/2 c. liquid from cabbage\\n\\nCut the cabbage into very small pieces with a sharp knife or a cabbage\\nchopper. Cook according to the directions given in Art. 89 until nearly\\ntender, and then drain. Spread 1/4 cupful of the buttered crumbs in the\\nbottom of a baking dish, put one-half of the cabbage over this, and then\\nadd another 1/4 cupful of the crumbs and the remaining cabbage. Over\\nthis pour a white sauce made from the butter, flour, salt, pepper, milk,\\nand liquid from the cabbage. Sprinkle the rest of the crumbs over the\\ntop. Bake in a slow oven until the cabbage is thoroughly heated through\\nand the crumbs are browned on top. This baking will complete the cooking\\nof the cabbage. Serve hot.  92. HOT SLAW.--If a slightly sour flavor is\\ndesired in a vegetable dish, hot slaw will undoubtedly appeal to\\nthe taste.\\n\\nHOT SLAW\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n4 c. cabbage\\n1 c. water\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/3 c. vinegar\\n1 egg\\n\\nSlice the cabbage very fine with a sharp knife or a cabbage cutter. Put\\nit in a saucepan, add the water, and allow it to cook until the water is\\nabout half evaporated. Melt the butter in a pan and to it add the flour,\\nsalt, and vinegar. Then stir the beaten egg in quickly and pour this\\nsauce over the cabbage at once. Allow the mixture to cook until the\\nsauce has thickened, stirring constantly to prevent the curding of the\\negg. Serve hot.\\n\\n93. MAKING SAUERKRAUT.--As is well known, sauerkraut is a cabbage\\npreparation that is made by salting finely cut cabbage, packing it\\ntightly, and allowing it to ferment under pressure. This food is made\\nand sold commercially, so that the housewife can usually purchase it in\\nany quantity she desires. However, as it is not at all difficult to make\\nsauerkraut, and as a supply of cabbage in this form provides a valuable\\narticle of food during the winter months in households where it is\\nrelished, the housewife will do well to prepare enough of this kind of\\ncabbage to vary her meals during the winter. That she may understand how\\nto proceed with the making of sauerkraut and the proper cooking of it,\\nthe accompanying directions and recipes are given.\\n\\n94. For every 10 medium-sized heads of cabbage, measure 2 cupfuls of\\nsalt. Cut the heads of cabbage into quarters and shred on a cabbage\\nslicer, or cutter. Place several inches of the shredded cabbage in the\\nbottom of a large crock, and over it sprinkle a layer of salt. Stamp\\nthis down with a wooden potato masher or some other similar utensil.\\nThen add another layer of cabbage and salt and stamp this down in the\\nsame way. Proceed in this manner until the crock is nearly full. Then\\nplace a clean cloth over the cabbage in the crock. On this cloth place a\\nclean board as near the size of the crock as possible, and on the board\\nplace a large clean stone or some other weight. When thus filled and\\nweighted down, place the crock in a cool place. The cabbage will then\\nbegin to ferment, and it is this fermentation that changes the cabbage\\ninto sauerkraut. After a time, juice will form and gradually rise over\\nthe top of the board, and on top of this juice will form a scum. Remove\\nthis scum at once, and do not allow any to collect at any time after the\\nfermentation of the cabbage ceases. Occasionally, when a supply of\\nsauerkraut is taken from the crock for cooking, replace the cloth by a\\nclean one, but always be sure to put the board and the weight back\\nin place.\\n\\n95. SAUERKRAUT WITH SPARERIBS.--Persons who are fond of sauerkraut find\\nthe combination of sauerkraut and spareribs very appetizing. The\\nspareribs give the cabbage a very pleasing flavor and at the same time\\nsupply nourishment to the dish.\\n\\nSAUERKRAUT WITH SPARERIBS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 qt. sauerkraut\\n2 lb. spareribs\\n1 tsp. salt\\n3 c. water\\n\\nPut the sauerkraut and the spareribs into a kettle and add the salt and\\nwater. Allow to simmer slowly for 2 or more hours. If additional water\\nis necessary, add it from time to time. Just before removing from the\\nheat, allow the water to boil down so that what remains may be served\\nwith the hot sauerkraut.\\n\\n96. BAKED SAUERKRAUT.--In the cooking of sauerkraut for the table, pork\\nin one form or another is generally added; in fact, one rarely thinks of\\nsauerkraut except in combination with pork. While boiling is the method\\nthat is usually applied to this vegetable, many housewives prefer to\\nbake it, for then the odor does not escape so easily and a flavor that\\nmost persons prefer is developed.\\n\\nBAKED SAUERKRAUT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 lb. fresh pork\\n1 qt. sauerkraut\\n1 Tb. salt\\n3 c. water\\n\\nCut the pork into several large chunks, and put it with the sauerkraut\\ninto a baking dish that has a cover. Add the salt and water, cover the\\ndish and place in the oven. Bake slowly for 2 or 3 hours. Serve hot.\\n\\n97. SAUT\\u00c9D SAUERKRAUT.--If an entirely different way of cooking\\nsauerkraut is desired, it may be saut\\u00e9d. When nicely browned and served\\nwith boiled frankfurters, it is very appetizing.\\n\\nSAUT\\u00c9D SAUERKRAUT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 qt. sauerkraut\\n4 Tb. bacon or ham fat\\n2 tsp. salt\\n\\nSteam the sauerkraut over boiling water for about 1 hour. Then melt the\\nfat in an iron frying pan, add the sauerkraut and sprinkle with the\\nsalt. Place a cover over the pan and allow the sauerkraut to saut\\u00e9 until\\nit is slightly browned on the bottom. Stir and continue to cook until\\nthe entire amount is slightly browned. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nCARROTS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n98. CARROTS are one of the root vegetables. They are similar in\\ncomposition to beets, having practically the same total food value,\\nwhich is for the most part carbohydrate in the form of sugar. Besides\\nbeing valuable in the diet for their mineral salts and bulk, they add\\nvariety to the menu, especially in the winter, for upon maturing they\\ncan be kept for a long time if they are properly stored. As tiny young\\ncarrots, they are also much used as a summer vegetable, and when cooked\\nwhole and served in an attractive way they make a delicious\\nvegetable dish.\\n\\n99. SELECTION AND PREPARATION.--The selection of carrots is a simple\\nmatter, because they keep well and are not likely to be found in a\\nspoiled condition in the market. When small summer carrots are\\npurchased, they should be fresh and should have their tops on. Winter\\ncarrots should be as nearly uniform in size as possible and should not\\nbe extremely large. Those which are too large in circumference are\\nlikely to have a hollow in the center and are not nearly so desirable as\\nthin, solid ones. Carrots of any kind should be uniform in color, and\\nshould be without the green portion that is sometimes found on the top\\nnear the stem and that is caused by exposure to the light in growing.\\n\\n100. In preparing carrots for cooking, they should be scraped rather\\nthan peeled, in order to avoid wasting any of the vegetable. They are\\nalways cooked in boiling salted water, after which they can be treated\\nin various ways. The water in which carrots are cooked should not be\\nthrown away, as it may be used to flavor soup stock. If any carrots\\nremain after a meal, they may be utilized in vegetable salad or soup.\\n\\n101. BUTTERED CARROTS.--If small, tender carrots can be obtained, they\\nwill be found to be delicious upon being boiled and then dressed with\\nbutter. Winter carrots may be prepared in this way too, but they will\\nprobably require a little more cooking to make them tender.\\n\\nBUTTERED CARROTS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c. diced carrots\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nWash and scrape the carrots and cut into half-inch pieces. Put to cook\\nin enough boiling water to cover the carrots well, and add 1 teaspoonful\\nof salt for each quart of water. Cook in a covered kettle until they can\\nbe easily pierced with a fork and then drain off the water. Add the\\nbutter, salt, and pepper, heat until the butter melts, and serve.\\n\\n102. CARROTS WITH PARSLEY.--The addition of parsley to carrots gives a\\nflavor that improves them very much. This should be chopped fine and\\nadded after the carrots have cooked sufficiently.\\n\\nCARROTS WITH PARSLEY\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c. sliced carrots\\n3 Tb. parsley finely chopped\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nWash and scrape the carrots, slice in very thin slices, and cook until\\ntender in boiling salted water. Drain and add the chopped parsley,\\nbutter, salt, and pepper. Mix carefully so as not to break the slices of\\ncarrot. Serve hot.\\n\\n103. BROWNED CARROTS.--A very appetizing way in which to prepare carrots\\nis to cut them in slices lengthwise, boil them until tender, and then\\nbrown them in fat. Wash and scrape the desired number of carrots, cut\\ninto slices lengthwise, and if large-sized carrots are used, cut the\\nslices into halves. Cook in boiling salted water until tender and then\\ndrain. Melt some fat in a frying pan, place the carrots in the hot fat,\\nand brown first on one side and then on the other, turning the slices\\ncarefully so as not to break them. A few minutes before removing the\\ncarrots from the frying pan, sprinkle sugar over them and allow the\\nsugar to melt. In removing them to a vegetable dish, pour over them the\\nsirup that forms. Serve hot.\\n\\n CAULIFLOWER AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n104. CAULIFLOWER grows in heads as does cabbage, but only the flower or\\nblossom of the plant is eaten. A head of cauliflower from which the\\nleaves have not been removed is shown in Fig. 8. In flavor and\\ncomposition this vegetable is similar to cabbage, but its flavor is a\\nlittle more delicate. Still, cauliflower should always be cooked in an\\nuncovered vessel, as are cabbage and Brussels sprouts, if a strong\\ndisagreeable flavor would be avoided.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8]\\n\\n105. SELECTION AND COOKING.--Very solid heads of cauliflower that are\\ncreamy white in color and free from the black specks or blemishes so\\ncommon to this vegetable should be selected for cooking. The only care\\nthat cauliflower requires before cooking is to keep it in a cool place,\\nfor it does not wilt nor decay quickly.\\n\\nTo prepare this vegetable for cooking, the white head should be cut from\\nthe leaves, which are discarded. Then the head should be placed upside\\ndown in a pan of salt water and allowed to soak for an hour in order to\\ndrive out the small bugs or worms that are so frequently found in this\\nvegetable. The cauliflower may then be cooked whole or broken apart, but\\nin either case it should be cooked until tender in boiling salted water\\nwith the cover removed from the kettle.\\n\\n106. CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE.--Variety can be secured in the\\npreparation of cauliflower by serving it with a tomato sauce. Besides\\nbeing very palatable, this is an extremely attractive dish because of\\nthe contrast in colors. Chicken gravy may be used instead of tomato\\nsauce, and a most delightful dish is the result.\\n\\nCAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 head cauliflower\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n2 c. strained tomato\\n\\nSoak the cauliflower in cold salted water, and then tie it carefully in\\na piece of cheesecloth and put it to cook in boiling salted water. Cook\\nuntil tender, but not so long that it will fall to pieces. Take from the\\nwater, remove the cheesecloth carefully, and place the cauliflower in a\\nvegetable dish. While the cauliflower is cooking, prepare the sauce by\\nmelting the butter in a double boiler, adding the flour, salt, and\\npepper, and stirring into this the heated strained tomato made by\\nforcing canned or stewed tomatoes through a sieve. Cook until the sauce\\nhas thickened and then pour over the cauliflower in the vegetable dish.\\nServe hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9]\\n\\n107. SCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER.--Another opportunity to make a delicious\\nscalloped dish is afforded by cauliflower. In fact, many persons prefer\\nscalloped cauliflower to any of the dishes made from this vegetable. The\\ningredients used with the cauliflower increase its food value, which is\\nsomewhat low.\\n\\nSCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 head cauliflower\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 c. milk\\n1 c. water from cauliflower\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. buttered crumbs\\n\\nPrepare and cook the cauliflower according to the directions given in\\nArt. 105, breaking it into flowerets before pouring the boiling water on\\nit. When it has cooked tender, drain the water from it. Prepare a sauce\\nwith the butter, flour, milk, water from the cauliflower, salt, and\\npepper. Butter the crumbs by pouring 1 tablespoonful of melted butter\\nover them. Put 1/4 cupful of the crumbs on the bottom of a baking dish,\\nadd one-half of the cauliflower, and over this place another 1/4 cupful\\nof crumbs. Then add the remainder of the cauliflower, and pour the white\\nsauce over all. Sprinkle the remainder of the crumbs over the top. Place\\nin a hot oven and bake until well heated through and brown on top. Serve\\nfrom the dish.\\n\\n108. CREAMED CAULIFLOWER.--A very attractive vegetable dish can be\\nprepared from cauliflower by cooking the head whole and then serving a\\ncream sauce over it, as shown in Fig. 9. In serving, a portion of the\\nhead should be broken off for each person and served with a little of\\nthe cream sauce.\\n\\nCREAMED CAULIFLOWER\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 head cauliflower\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 c. milk\\n1/2 c. water in which cauliflower was cooked\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nSoak a solid head of cauliflower in cold salted water for about 1 hour.\\nThen wash thoroughly, wrap carefully in cheesecloth, and cook in boiling\\nsalted water until tender. When sufficiently cooked, drain, and make a\\nsauce of the other ingredients. Place the cauliflower in a vegetable\\ndish, pour the white sauce over it, and serve hot.\\n\\n\\nCELERY AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n109. CELERY is the stem of a plant that grows in stalks, as shown in\\nFig. 10. When the stalks are large, they are sold singly, but if they\\nare very small, several of them are tied together and sold in a bunch.\\nThe season for celery begins in the fall and lasts until early spring.\\nIt may be obtained in the summer, but as the price is usually high and\\nthe quality not good, very little use should be made of it during\\nthat time.\\n\\nThe chief use of celery is as a relish, when it is eaten raw, but it is\\nalso valuable for flavoring soups and making salads, pickles, and\\nvarious other dishes. It is probably used less frequently as a cooked\\nvegetable than in any other way, but when it is in season and can be\\npurchased at a reasonable price, it should be cooked to give variety\\nto the diet.\\n\\nThe food value of celery is extremely low, being less than 100 calories\\nto the pound or about equal to that of 1 ounce of meat. However, in\\nspite of this fact, celery is valuable for its mineral salts and bulk,\\nas well as for the appetizing quality that it lends to various foods and\\nto the meals at which it is served.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10]\\n\\n110. CARE AND PREPARATION.--Well-bleached, firm stalks of celery should\\nbe selected for use. After it comes into the house, it may be kept in\\ngood condition for a long time if it is wrapped in a damp cloth and put\\nwhere it will keep cool. A good plan is to serve the hearts and tender\\ninside stems raw, as explained in _Soup_, and then to use the coarse\\noutside stems for cooking, flavoring soups, or making salads. Celery\\nmust be cleaned carefully for dirt often clings to the ridges. After\\nbeing scrubbed thoroughly, it will become crisp and tender if it is\\nallowed to stand in cold water for some time before serving. When it is\\nto be served as a cooked vegetable, it should be cooked in boiling\\nsalted water, as are other vegetables, and then seasoned or dressed in\\nany desirable way. The water in which it is cooked should be utilized in\\nthe making of sauce or soup.\\n\\n111. CREAMED CELERY.--The usual way of preparing celery when it is to be\\nserved as a cooked vegetable is to cream it. The cream sauce that is\\nadded to the celery increases its food value considerably and greatly\\nimproves its flavor. This sauce may be made entirely of milk or of half\\nmilk and half liquid from the celery.\\n\\nCREAMED CELERY\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c. diced celery\\n3 Tb. butter\\n3 Tb. flour\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n1/2 c. water in which celery was cooked\\n\\nCook the celery in boiling salted water until tender, and then drain.\\nWhen the celery has cooked, make a white sauce of the other ingredients.\\nPour this sauce over the cooked celery, heat together, and serve.\\n\\n112. CELERY AU GRATIN.--The food value of celery may be still further\\nincreased by combining it with cheese and bread crumbs in addition to a\\ncream sauce. Such a dish, which is known as _celery au gratin_, is\\nprepared according to the accompanying recipe.\\n\\nCELERY AU GRATIN\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n4 c. diced celery\\n2-1/2 Tb. butter\\n2-1/2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n1 c. water in which celery was cooked\\n1 c. buttered crumbs\\n1/2 c. grated cheese\\n\\nCook the celery in boiling salted water until tender and then drain.\\nPrepare the cream sauce in the usual manner. Butter the crumbs by\\nstirring them into 1 tablespoonful of melted butter. Put 1/4 cupful of\\nthe crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish and put one-half of the celery\\nover them. Place another 1/4 cupful of the crumbs over the celery, and\\non top of this sprinkle 1/4 cupful of the grated cheese. Add the\\nremainder of the celery and pour the sauce over this. Finally, add the\\nother 1/4 cupful of cheese and the remainder of the crumbs. Place in a\\nhot oven, and bake until well heated through and the crumbs are browned.\\nServe hot.\\n\\n\\nCORN AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n113. The seeds of the maize plant, or Indian corn, especially the\\nvariety known as _sweet corn_, are eaten as a vegetable when they are\\nimmature. They grow on a woody cob, and when they are green they are\\nsoft and milky; but when they become ripe they are hard and are then\\nground as grain. Many varieties of sweet corn are used, but some are\\nbetter in quality than others. In some varieties, the kernels, or seeds,\\nare yellow, while in others they are white; also, some of them are\\nsuitable for use early in the summer, while others come later in the\\nseason. However, in spite of this difference in quality, color, and\\nseason, all kinds of corn used as a vegetable are called _green corn_\\nand may be prepared in exactly the same ways.\\n\\n114. The food value of corn, which is very high, even exceeding that of\\nIrish potatoes, is due principally to the carbohydrate it contains. This\\nfood substance is in the form of sugar in the green kernels, but as they\\nmature it changes to starch. The food value of the dry grain is\\ntherefore higher, and the carbohydrate is in a different form.\\n\\nWhen the contents of the kernels is still in the liquid form, the corn\\nis said to be at the _milk stage_, and is generally considered to be too\\nyoung for table use. On the other hand, when the liquid in the kernels\\nhas become thickened, the corn, which is then at the _dough stage_, is\\nthought to be too old for use as a vegetable. To be ideal for culinary\\npurposes, it should be just between the milk and dough stages. Then, if\\nit is in good condition, a most satisfactory vegetable is the result.\\n\\n115. The ear on which the corn kernels grow is entirely encased in\\nseveral layers of husks. These are not removed until just before the\\ncorn is to be cooked; so when this vegetable is in the market the husks\\nare allowed to remain on the ears. The condition of the ears can be\\ndetermined by stripping the husks down a little and examining the\\nkernels. If they are well filled, they may be considered to be in proper\\ncondition; otherwise, they will not be suitable for cooking. No special\\ncare need be given to green corn, provided it is not husked. However,\\nwhen it has been husked, it should be cooked at once. In the husking of\\ncorn, all corn silk that is found inside of the husks should be\\ncarefully removed, for this is very annoying in the cooked vegetable and\\nits presence indicates carelessness.\\n\\n116. CORN ON THE COB.--The simplest way in which to prepare green corn\\nis to cook it on the cob. When corn first comes into the market, it is\\nusually very tender and makes a most satisfactory dish when prepared\\nin this way.\\n\\nTo cook corn on the cob, husk the corn, remove the silk from the ears,\\nand place them in a kettle. Pour enough boiling water over them to cover\\nthem well, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. Boil 5\\nminutes, remove from the water, and serve at once. In eating corn on the\\ncob, most persons dress it with butter, pepper, and salt.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11]\\n\\n117. CORN COOKED IN MILK.--Often it is not desired to eat corn on the\\ncob. When this is the case, it may be cut off the ear and cooked in\\nvarious ways. A simple way to prepare it is to cook it with milk and\\nseason it with salt, pepper, and butter, as explained in the\\naccompanying recipe.\\n\\nSelect the desired number of ears of green corn, husk them, and remove\\nthe silk. Then, as shown in Fig. 11, cut the corn from the cob with a\\nsharp knife, grasping the ear by the larger end and cutting upwards.\\nAfter cutting off the kernels, scrape the ears so that nothing edible\\nwill be wasted, drawing the knife downwards. Put the corn into a\\nsaucepan, add milk until the corn is nearly covered, and season with\\nsalt, pepper, and a little butter. Allow the corn to simmer for about 10\\nminutes, stirring frequently to prevent the milk from sticking to the\\nbottom of the pan and scorching. No difficulty will be experienced in\\nthe preparation of this dish if a double boiler is used, but longer\\ncooking will be required. When the corn is sufficiently cooked, remove\\nfrom the fire and serve hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 12]  118. CORN PULP.--Some persons are unable to\\ndigest the coarse hulls of green corn, but can eat the corn if the hulls\\nare removed. Such persons need not be deprived of the delights of this\\nvegetable, for it may be prepared in the form of pulp, which will not\\ndisagree with them.\\n\\nTo prepare corn pulp, first cut a slit down each row of kernels with a\\nsharp knife as shown in Fig. 12; then, in the manner shown in Fig. 13,\\nscrape out the contents of the kernels with the dull edge of the knife,\\ndrawing the knife downwards. When all the pulp has been removed, season\\nit with salt, pepper, and butter, and heat it thoroughly in a double\\nboiler. Serve hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\\n\\nIf it is not desirable to serve the corn pulp in this manner, it may be\\nused in various ways, as the following recipes indicate. A good\\nsubstitute for corn pulp is canned corn, but this must be chopped in\\norder to break up the hulls.\\n\\n119. CORN SOUFFL\\u00c9.--No more delightful corn dish can be prepared than\\ncorn souffl\\u00e9, for in addition to its being appetizing and nutritious, it\\nis extremely dainty. It may be cooked in a baking dish, but it is more\\nattractive when baked in individual baking dishes. A point to remember\\nabout its preparation is that it should be served immediately upon being\\ntaken from the oven, for souffl\\u00e9 always shrinks as it cools.\\n\\nCORN SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. green corn pulp\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n2 Tb. melted butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/4 c. milk\\n2 eggs\\n\\nMix the corn pulp, salt, pepper, and melted butter, stir in the flour,\\nand add the milk. Separate the eggs, beat the yolks, and add them to the\\nmixture. Then beat the whites stiff and fold them in. Pour into a\\nbuttered baking dish or into individual baking dishes, set in a pan of\\nhot water, and bake until brown. Serve at once.\\n\\n120. CORN OYSTERS.--Variety can be secured in the use of corn by making\\ncorn oysters. These get their name from the fact that they resemble\\noysters in both size and shape. They may be served as a garnish for a\\nmeat dish or as a vegetable dish.\\n\\nCORN OYSTERS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. corn pulp\\n1 egg\\n1/4 c. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1/2 tsp. baking powder\\n\\nPrepare the corn pulp according to the directions given in Art. 118. To\\nthis add the beaten egg, flour, salt, pepper, and baking powder. Drop in\\ntablespoonfuls on a well-greased griddle. When brown on one side, turn\\nand brown on the other side. Then fold through the center, doubling one\\nside over the other. Serve hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\\n\\n121. CORN FRITTERS.--The popularity of corn fritters, which have corn\\npulp as their foundation, is undoubtedly due both to their flavor and to\\nthe variety they afford in the diet. After being fried, corn fritters\\nshould appear as shown in Fig. 14. They may be served plain, but most\\npersons prefer them with a sauce of some kind or with maple sirup.\\n\\nCORN FRITTERS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. corn pulp, or 1 can corn, chopped\\n1 c. flour\\n1 tsp. baking powder\\n1 tsp. salt\\n2 eggs\\n\\nIf canned corn is used, drain off the liquid before using it. To the\\ncorn, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs and stir\\nin the beaten yolks. Beat the whites stiff and fold them into the\\nmixture. Drop with a spoon into deep fat, fry until brown, remove from\\nthe fat, and drain on paper. Serve plain, with a desired sauce, or with\\nmaple sirup.\\n\\n\\nCUCUMBERS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n122. The hard-rinded fruit of the cucumber plant has been used from time\\nimmemorial as a vegetable. In food value, cucumbers are very low,\\ncomparing closely with celery in this respect; however, as they contain\\na large amount of cellulose, or bulk, and mineral salts, they should not\\nbe disregarded in the diet. They have a rather strong flavor due to\\ntheir volatile oils, which so frequently disagree with persons and which\\ngive cucumbers a reputation for being difficult to digest. However, when\\nthey are properly prepared, they can be eaten by most persons\\nwithout harm.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\\n\\n123. Formerly it was the custom to soak slices of cucumber in salt water\\nbefore serving them. This procedure, however, has been found to be poor\\npolicy, for nothing is gained by it and the salt toughens the cellulose\\nand makes the cucumbers limp and rubbery in texture. A much more\\nsatisfactory way to prepare cucumbers is to slice them and then soak\\nthem for some time before serving in ice water or water as cold as can\\nbe obtained. They will then become crisp and delicious, and, besides\\nbeing more appetizing and agreeable, they will be no less digestible.\\nAfter being sliced and chilled, cucumbers are often combined with sliced\\nonions and eaten with vinegar, salt, and pepper, or they are eaten alone\\nor on lettuce, dressed with mayonnaise dressing.\\n\\n124. STUFFED CUCUMBERS.--Possibly the only recipe for cooked cucumbers\\nthat is used to any extent is the accompanying one for stuffed\\ncucumbers. Cucumbers prepared in this way are very palatable, and\\nbecause of the ingredients used are much higher in food value than when\\neaten alone. Such a dish is attractive, too, as Fig. 15 shows.\\n\\nSTUFFED CUCUMBERS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 cucumbers\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1 small onion, chopped\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1-1/2 c. steamed rice\\n1 c. stewed tomatoes\\nBread crumbs\\n\\nSelect medium-sized cucumbers, wash and peel them, and cut them in half\\nlengthwise. Hollow out the center so that the cucumbers will have the\\nshape of boats. Then melt the butter in a frying pan, add the chopped\\nonion, salt, and pepper, and heat together for a few minutes. Next add\\nthe rice, tomatoes, and sufficient bread crumbs to take up any excess of\\nmoisture. Fill the cucumbers with this mixture and bake until they are\\nsoft enough to be easily pierced with a fork. During the first part of\\nthe cooking, pour a small amount of hot water into the pan in which the\\ncucumbers are baked. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nEGGPLANT AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n125. EGGPLANT belongs to the class of fruit vegetables, and is closely\\nrelated to the tomato in structure and composition. It grows rather\\nlarge in size, is covered with a smooth brownish-purple skin, and is\\nmade up of material that is close and firm in texture and creamy white\\nin color. Because of the nature of its structure, eggplant would seem to\\nbe high in food value, but, on the contrary, this vegetable has very\\nlittle. In this respect, it is about equal to cabbage and cauliflower\\nand slightly less than string beans.\\n\\n126. Eggplant is found in the market from early summer until the\\nbeginning of winter. Because it is protected by a heavy skin, it keeps\\nwell and needs no special care in storage. The strong flavor of the\\npulp is disagreeable to many persons. However, it has been found that\\nmuch of this flavor may be removed by soaking the eggplant in strong\\nsalt water or by sprinkling it with salt after it has been sliced and\\nthen allowing it to stand for some time. It may be prepared in a variety\\nof ways; so, if the members of the family care for it, the housewife\\nwill find it of great assistance in planning and preparing meals.\\n\\n127. SAUT\\u00c9D EGGPLANT.--The usual way of preparing eggplant is to cut it\\ninto slices and then saut\\u00e9 it. As the slices are dipped into beaten egg\\nand then into crumbs before saut\\u00e9ing, the food value of this vegetable\\nis increased and its flavor improved.\\n\\nPeel the eggplant and then cut it into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle salt\\nover the slices and let them stand for 1 hour or more; then pour off the\\njuice that has collected. Beat an egg slightly, and to it add a few\\ntablespoonfuls of milk or water. Dip the slices of eggplant first into\\nthe beaten egg and then into crumbs. When sufficiently coated, saut\\u00e9 in\\nshallow fat, browning first on one side and then on the other.\\nServe hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16]\\n\\n128. BAKED EGGPLANT.--An attractive dish can be made by removing the\\ncontents from an eggplant, filling the cavity with a well-seasoned\\nstuffing, and then baking the stuffed eggplant. When an eggplant is\\nprepared in this way, it will appear as in Fig. 16.\\n\\nBAKED EGGPLANT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 medium-sized eggplant\\n2 c. dried bread crumbs\\n1/2 c. milk\\n2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1 small onion, chopped\\n1 Tb. parsley\\n2 Tb. butter\\n\\nWash the eggplant and cook in boiling water for about 10 minutes. Remove\\nfrom the water, cut off the top, scoop out the contents, and chop it\\ninto small pieces. With this finely chopped pulp, mix the bread crumbs,\\nmilk, salt, pepper, onion, parsley, and melted butter. When the whole is\\nthoroughly blended, pack it into the shell of the eggplant and place in\\nthe oven. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the stuffing is thoroughly\\ncooked and the top is brown. Serve hot.\\n\\n129. SCALLOPED EGGPLANT.--If it is desired to increase the food value of\\neggplant and improve its flavor too, this vegetable should be scalloped.\\nThe accompanying recipe carefully followed will produce a most\\nappetizing dish.\\n\\nSCALLOPED EGGPLANT\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 medium-sized eggplant\\n1 c. dried crumbs\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1-1/2 c. milk\\n\\nPeel the eggplant and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Put into a saucepan,\\ncover with boiling salted water, cook until tender, and then drain.\\nGrease a baking dish, spread 1/4 cupful of crumbs on the bottom, and add\\none-half of the eggplant. Dot with butter and then sprinkle with salt\\nand pepper. Add another 1/4 cupful of crumbs and the remaining eggplant,\\ndot again with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the milk\\nover the whole and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cupful of crumbs on the\\ntop. Place in the oven and bake for 1/2 hour or more. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nFRENCH ARTICHOKES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n130. FRENCH ARTICHOKES, sometimes known as _globe artichokes, California\\nartichokes_, and _cardoons_, are related to the family of thistles. They\\nare grown for the sake of their large flower-heads, or buds, which are\\nshown in Fig. 17 and which are much used as a food. These plants stand\\nstorage and shipment very well and may be kept for long periods of time\\nwithout spoiling. It is therefore possible to transport them\\nconsiderable distances, a very gratifying fact, since most persons\\nconsider artichokes a great delicacy.\\n\\n131. Not all of the artichoke plant is eaten. The portions of the flower\\nthat develop in the center of the base are removed before the base is\\neaten. After the artichokes are cooked, the scales, or leaves, are\\npulled from the cooked head with the fingers and the lower part of each\\none is dipped into sauce and eaten. The inner scales are much more\\ntender and edible than the coarse outside ones. Although artichokes\\nfind favor with many and are considered somewhat of a delicacy, they are\\nlow in food value, being about equal to asparagus in this respect. To\\nadd food material, a dressing, such as drawn-butter sauce or mayonnaise\\ndressing, is usually served.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17]\\n\\n132. ARTICHOKES WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.--The usual method of preparing\\nartichokes is to boil them and then serve them with melted butter or a\\nsauce. Hollandaise dressing is used with the artichokes shown in Fig.\\n18. Boiled artichokes may also be cooled and then served with a\\nsalad dressing.\\n\\nSecure the desired number of artichokes and prepare them for boiling by\\npulling off the coarse outside leaves, cutting off the top of the bud,\\nand removing the stem close to the bud. Cover well with boiling water,\\nadd 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart, and boil until tender, or for\\nabout 45 minutes. Remove from the water and serve hot with melted butter\\nor Hollandaise sauce. If it is desired to use them for a salad, allow\\nthem to cool before adding the salad dressing.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 18]\\n\\n VEGETABLES (PART 1)\\n\\nEXAMINATION QUESTIONS\\n\\n(1) (_a_) To what is the flavor of vegetables largely due?

Varieties of Greens.--The leaves and stems of many young plants in\\neither their wild or their cultivated form are used for food. All of\\nthem are similar in composition, but many of them differ in flavor and\\nappearance. The cultivated ones include beet tops, endive, spinach, and\\nkale, as well as lettuce, collards, Swiss chard, sorrel, mustard greens,\\nturnip tops, parsley, and cultivated cress and dandelion. The four\\ngreens mentioned first are illustrated in Fig. 1, beet tops being shown\\nin the lower right corner; endive, in the upper right corner; spinach,\\nin the lower left corner; and kale, in the upper left corner. Commonest\\namong the wild greens are dandelion, cress, wild mustard, dock, pokeweed\\nsprouts, milkweed sprouts, and lamb's-quarters. Most of these wild\\nvarieties are excellent in the spring when they are young and tender,\\nbut it is not advisable to use them for food unless one is perfectly\\nfamiliar with their appearance.\\n\\n2. Food Value of Greens.--The food value of all greens with the\\nexception of dandelion is very low, being just about equal to that of\\ncelery and cucumbers. This may be increased in their preparation by the\\naddition of other food materials. However, the chief use of greens in\\nthe diet is not to supply food value, but mineral salts, the most\\nimportant one being iron in a form that is necessary for building up\\nthe blood.\\n\\n GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING GREENS\\n\\n3. The cooking of greens, both wild and cultivated, is not only simple\\nbut practically the same for all varieties. When they are not used as a\\nsalad vegetable, they are merely boiled until tender and then dressed in\\nany desired way. Some kinds admit of special preparation, and wherever\\nthis is the case specific directions are given under the particular\\nvariety, but even in such an event the preliminary preparation is\\nthe same.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\\n\\nTo prepare greens, look them over carefully, remove any decayed or\\nwithered parts, cut off the leaves, and wash in fresh cold water. Remove\\nfrom the water and wash again, and do this as many times as seems\\nnecessary to remove all the sand and grit that the stalks contain. An\\nimportant point to remember is that the greens should not be cleansed by\\npouring the water off, as the sand will then remain in the pan and is\\nlikely to mix with the greens again. When they are thoroughly washed,\\nput them on to cook in a saucepan or a similar utensil. If they are\\nyoung and tender, they should be cooked as much as possible in their own\\njuice in order to retain all the valuable mineral salts they contain,\\nonly enough water being added to start the cooking without burning. In\\nthe case of greens that are very strong in flavor, it will be necessary\\nto cook them in a larger quantity of water and then pour off what\\nremains after cooking. When they have cooked until they are tender,\\nseason them if necessary, and add butter to give them flavor and\\nincrease their food value. Vinegar or a slice of lemon adds much to the\\nflavor of greens.\\n\\n BEET TOPS\\n\\n4. The tops of beets include the leaves and the stems of this vegetable,\\nas Fig. 1 shows. They are at their best when the beets are very young or\\nbefore the beets themselves have developed. Beet tops are not used so\\nextensively as some greens, but they will be found to have a more\\nagreeable flavor than many greens that are more popular. Beets are\\nraised for the purpose of supplying greens by planting the seeds closely\\nenough together to form a thick bed of leaves and then thinning them out\\nbefore the beets have developed. A few may be allowed to remain and\\ndevelop for use as beets. Young beets that are purchased with the tops\\non also furnish a source of beet tops as well as beets.\\n\\nWhen beet tops are to be cooked, cut the stems into inch lengths and use\\nthem with the leaves. Proceed to clean and cook the greens according to\\nthe directions given in Art. 3. Season with salt and pepper and flavor\\nwith butter. Serve with something tart, such as vinegar or lemon.\\n\\n\\nDANDELION\\n\\n5. Dandelion, both wild and cultivated, is a plant whose leaves are much\\nused for a vegetable green before the blossoms develop. The wild ones\\nhave the advantage of being cheap, so they should be used if they can be\\nsecured; the cultivated ones, on the other hand, cost as much as spinach\\nand other greens. The season for dandelions is comparatively short,\\nlasting only a few weeks in the early spring. Use should therefore be\\nmade of them when they can be procured in order to secure variety for\\nthe menu. When they are desired as cooked greens, prepare them in the\\nmanner explained in Art. 3.\\n\\n6. Dandelion With Sour Sauce.--If a change in the cooking of dandelion\\nis desired, it should be prepared with a sour sauce. This method of\\npreparation is very popular, for besides increasing the food value of\\nthis variety of greens, it improves the flavor very much.\\n\\nDANDELION WITH SOUR SAUCE\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1/2 pk. dandelion\\n1/2 c. vinegar\\n4 thin slices bacon\\n1/2 c. water\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 egg\\n1 tsp. salt\\n\\nClean and wash the dandelion. Cut the slices of bacon into small pieces\\nand saut\\u00e9 until crisp. Stir the flour and salt into the bacon fat, add\\nthe vinegar and water, and stir until the flour thickens. Add the beaten\\negg last, and remove from the fire. Put the dandelion into the pan and\\nmix well with the hot sauce. If the dandelion is preferred well wilted,\\nset the pan over the flame, and stir until the dandelion appears as\\ndesired. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nENDIVE\\n\\n7. ENDIVE is an herb that is used as a salad plant or is cooked and\\nserved with a hot dressing or as greens. The three common varieties of\\nthis green are escarole, chicory, and French endive, all of which have a\\nslightly bitter taste and may be found in the market from late summer\\nuntil early winter. _Escarole_ is a broad-leaved variety that is grown\\nmore or less in a head. _Chicory_, which is shown in Fig. 1, has a small\\nfeathery-edged leaf, and is often bleached by tying the leaves together\\nat the top, so that the inside ones are very tender. Both of these\\nvarieties may be cooked, but they are also much used for salads. _French\\nendive_ bears very little resemblance to the other kinds, having\\nstraight, creamy-white leaves that are closely pressed together. It\\nlooks very much like sprouts of some kind, and is entirely bleached in\\nthe process of growth by banking the earth around it. It is never used\\nfor anything except salads and garnishes.\\n\\n8. Endive is very low in food value, comparing very closely with celery\\nand cucumbers in this respect. Still, as a salad vegetable, it is worthy\\nof much more extensive use than is generally made of it. As a rule, its\\nprice is about the same as that of lettuce, so it should be substituted\\nfrequently for lettuce to give variety to the diet. To be most\\nsatisfactory, endive should be bought when it is fresh and unwithered\\nand kept until used in a cool, damp place. A good plan is to wrap such\\nvegetables in a damp cloth. If, upon using, endive appears to be\\nwithered, it may be freshened by placing it in a pan of cold water and\\nallowing it to remain there for a short time.\\n\\nWhen endive is used as a salad, it may be served merely with a salad\\ndressing of some kind or it may be combined with other vegetables before\\napplying the dressing. Escarole and chicory, which are much used as\\ngreens, should be prepared and cooked according to the directions given\\nin Art. 3.\\n\\n LETTUCES\\n\\n9. Lettuce is a well-known herb that is much used as a salad vegetable.\\nThere are numerous varieties of lettuce, but these may be reduced to the\\ntwo kinds shown in Fig. 2, _leaf lettuce_ on the right and _head\\nlettuce_ on the left. Leaf lettuce, which is more often used for\\ngarnishing than for any other purpose, has firm, crisp, green, upright\\nleaves; on the other hand, head lettuce has round leaves forming a\\ncompact head, like cabbage. The outside leaves of head lettuce are\\ngreen, but the inside ones are usually bleached by the exclusion of\\nlight, as are those of cabbage and endive. These inside leaves are more\\ntender than the others, and hence more to be desired as a salad\\nvegetable than the unbleached variety. In food value, lettuce compares\\nclosely with other varieties of greens and is high in the same mineral\\nsalts that they are. The bleached leaves do not contain so much iron as\\nthe green ones. [Illustration: FIG. 2]\\n\\n10. As has already been implied, lettuce finds its principal use in\\ngarnishing salads. When used for this purpose, it should be eaten along\\nwith the salad, for it is too valuable to be wasted. Since the coarse\\noutside leaves of a stalk or a head of lettuce do not look so well as\\nthe tender bleached ones, they are often rejected, but this should not\\nbe done, for use can also be made of them. For instance, such leaves may\\nbe shredded into narrow strips and used as a foundation for salads that\\nwill be just as attractive as those having a single lettuce leaf for a\\ngarnish. When it is realized that the outside leaves are purchased at\\nthe same price as the more delicate parts of the lettuce, it can readily\\nbe understood why they also should be utilized as food.  Most of the\\ngarden varieties of lettuce, especially when they have grown very large,\\nare frequently cooked as greens. When used in this way, lettuce is\\nprepared, as are other greens, according to the directions given in Art.\\n3. This vegetable also makes an appetizing dish when it is prepared with\\na sauce and served hot in the same way as dandelion.\\n\\n\\nSPINACH\\n\\n11. SPINACH, which is shown in Fig. 1, consists of the large, fleshy,\\ndeep-green leaves of a garden herb much used as a green for food. In\\nfact, this is one of the most popular varieties of greens and is used\\nmore extensively than any other. Many varieties of spinach are grown,\\nbut all of them are used in just the same way. It is slightly higher in\\nfood value than lettuce and endive, but lower than dandelion. However,\\nit is a valuable food in the diet because of the large quantity of iron\\nit contains, and many persons eat it not so much because they like it\\nbut because they believe it is good for them.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\\n\\n12. Some kinds of spinach do not keep for long periods of time.\\nTherefore, in order to avoid any waste, spinach should always be very\\nfresh when purchased and should be used as soon as possible after it is\\nobtained. It may be prepared in a greater number of ways than most of\\nthe other greens except, perhaps, those used for salads. For instance,\\nit is served with entr\\u00e9es of various kinds, is combined with meat, ham\\nand spinach being a much used combination, or is made into a pur\\u00e9e by\\nforcing it through a sieve and then used in the making of soup or\\nsouffl\\u00e9. Then, again, spinach is often boiled and pressed into small\\ncups to form molds like the one shown in Fig. 3. Such a mold may be used\\nto garnish a dish of some sort or, as here shown, may be garnished with\\na slice of hard-cooked egg. When spinach is used in any of these ways,\\nit should first be cooked according to the directions given for the\\npreparation of greens in Art. 3.  13. SPINACH SOUFFL\\u00c9.--The pur\\u00e9e that\\nis made by forcing boiled spinach through a sieve may be used in a\\nvariety of ways, but none of these is more satisfactory than spinach\\nsouffl\\u00e9. When made according to the accompanying recipe, spinach souffl\\u00e9\\nwill be found to be appetizing as well as nourishing.\\n\\nSPINACH SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/2 c. hot milk\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1 c. spinach pur\\u00e9e\\n1 tsp. salt\\n2 egg whites\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nMelt the butter, add the flour, salt, pepper, and hot milk, and stir in\\nthe spinach pur\\u00e9e. Beat the egg whites stiff and fold them into the\\nmixture. Grease individual baking dishes or a large baking dish and fill\\ntwo-thirds full with the mixture. Place in a pan of hot water and bake\\nin a slow oven until firm, or for about 20 or 30 minutes.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\\n\\n14. SPINACH ROYAL.--A very attractive dish can be made by combining\\nspinach with toast, hard-cooked egg, and lemon in the manner shown in\\nFig. 4. This dish is known as _spinach royal_, and because of the\\nadditional ingredients it is nutritious as well as palatable.\\n\\nSPINACH ROYAL\\n(Sufficient to Serve Four)\\n\\n1/2 pk. spinach\\n1/3 c. water\\n1-1/2 tsp. salt\\n3 Tb. bacon fat or butter\\n3 Tb. flour\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\nTriangular pieces of toast\\n2 hard-cooked eggs\\n1 lemon\\n\\nLook the spinach over carefully and remove all roots and dead leaves.\\nCut the stalks apart and wash them thoroughly several times in fresh,\\nclean water to remove the sand and dirt, lifting the spinach out of the\\nwater each time instead of pouring the water off. Put the spinach into a\\nsaucepan with the water. Stir frequently until the spinach is wilted and\\nthere is sufficient water to boil it. Add 1 teaspoonful of the salt and\\ncook until the leaves are very tender, or for about 15 or 20 minutes.\\nDrain off all but about 1/2 cupful of the liquid. Melt the fat in a\\nfrying pan, stir the flour into it, brown to a golden brown, and then\\nadd the spinach, pepper, and remaining salt. Stir and cook until the\\nflour has thickened and mixed well with the spinach. Turn out in a mound\\non a platter and place the pieces of toast around the spinach as shown.\\nSlice the hard-cooked eggs, cut the lemon into any desirable shape, and\\nuse these to garnish the platter. In serving this dish, put a spoonful\\nof spinach on a piece of toast and serve a slice or two of egg and lemon\\nwith each portion.\\n\\n15. CREAMED SPINACH.--After spinach has been boiled until it is tender,\\nit may be made more appetizing by combining it with a well-flavored\\ncream sauce, according to the accompanying directions.\\n\\nCREAMED SPINACH\\n(Sufficient to Serve Four)\\n\\n1/2 pk. spinach\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n2 Tb. ham or bacon fat\\nDash of pepper\\n2 Tb. flour\\n2/3 c. milk\\n\\nBoil the spinach according to the directions given in Art. 3. Melt the\\nfat in a frying pan, add the flour, salt, pepper, and milk, and stir\\nuntil the flour thickens. Chop the cooked spinach and add it to the hot\\ndressing. Stir and cook until the two are well blended. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nWATERCRESS AND PARSLEY\\n\\n16. WATERCRESS and PARSLEY are two herbs, or greens, that are used\\nconsiderably for garnishing and flavoring other dishes. These greens are\\nshown in Fig. 5, that at the left being watercress and that at the\\nright parsley.\\n\\n17. Watercress, which is commonly known as _peppercress_, usually grows\\nwild in beds along the banks of springs or clear, cool streams. A few\\nvarieties, however, are cultivated, and these are grown in dry soil and\\nknown as _upland cress_. It is a very prolific herb, and may be obtained\\nfrom early spring until late in the fall; in fact, it does not freeze\\neasily and is sometimes found in early winter along the swiftly flowing\\nstreams that are not frozen over. Watercress may be used whenever it can\\nbe procured, but it is not very desirable when in blossom. Its chief use\\nis to garnish salads and other dishes, but it may also be cooked and\\nserved hot as a green. In such an event, its cooking is accomplished in\\nthe same way as that of other greens.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\\n\\n18. Parsley, while classified as a green vegetable, is perhaps not in\\nthe true sense of the word a real vegetable, since it is used for only\\ntwo purposes, and in neither of these is it served cooked or raw as an\\nexclusive article of diet. The most important use of parsley is perhaps\\nthat of flavoring. It is added to soups, sauces, and various kinds of\\ncooked vegetables in order to impart additional flavor. In such cases,\\nit should be chopped very fine in order that all possible flavor may be\\nextracted from it. Parsley may also be dried before it is used for this\\npurpose, provided it must be kept for any length of time. The other use\\nof parsley is that of garnishing. It is often used in small sprays to\\ngarnish a roast of meat, a steak, chops, fish, or some baked, fried, or\\nsaut\\u00e9d vegetable. Sometimes it is chopped very fine and placed around\\nthe edge of a patty shell, a croustade, a timbale case, or a piece of\\ntoast upon which food is served. Parsley may be eaten when it is served\\nas a garnish if its flavor is found to be agreeable to the taste.\\n\\n JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n19. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES are tubers belonging to the sunflower family.\\nIn appearance they resemble potatoes to some extent, but, as a rule,\\nthey are neither so large nor so smooth. The inside texture of this\\nvegetable is more moist and not so mealy as that of the Irish potato.\\nJerusalem artichokes are easy to grow and are very prolific, so that if\\nany one is fond of them they will be found to be a profitable crop. For\\ntable use, they are prepared in much the same way as potatoes.\\n\\n20. CREAMED ARTICHOKES.--A common method of preparing Jerusalem\\nartichokes is to cream them. Wash and peel the desired number of\\nartichokes and cut them into 1/2-inch dice. Put these to cook in boiling\\nsalted water and cook until tender enough to be pierced with a fork.\\nDrain off the water and dress with hot medium white sauce. Serve hot.\\n\\n21. BUTTERED ARTICHOKES.--Another satisfactory way in which to prepare\\nJerusalem artichokes is to dress them with butter. Wash and peel the\\nrequired number of artichokes and cut them into slices. Put these to\\ncook in boiling salted water and cook until tender enough to be pierced\\nwith a fork. Drain off the water and dress with melted butter to which\\nhas been added a little chopped parsley. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nKOHLRABI AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n22. KOHLRABI is a variety of cabbage having a turnip-shaped stem. On\\naccount of its shape it is often called _turnip cabbage_. The edible\\npart of kohlrabi is the enlarged stem, which has the flavor of both\\nturnip and cabbage. The stems of the leaves are attached to the enlarged\\nportion that is used for food, and these must be removed in the\\npreparation of the vegetable. Kohlrabi is not a perishable vegetable and\\ntherefore stands storage very well. For market, it is usually placed in\\nbunches and tied as are beets and carrots. In food value, this\\nvegetable, like cabbage, is somewhat low. The food value it does have is\\ncarbohydrate in the form of sugar.  23. After the stems of the leaves\\nhave been cut off, the kohlrabi should be washed and then pared to\\nremove the outer skin. It is usually diced or sliced thin, and then\\ncooked and dressed in any desirable way. This vegetable, like cabbage,\\ncauliflower, etc., should be cooked with the cover removed from the\\nkettle, in order to allow some of the flavor to escape in the steam.\\nKohlrabi that is old or that has been in storage for some time develops\\nwoody portions as do turnips, beets, and other winter vegetables, and\\nmust therefore be cooked sufficiently long to make it palatable.\\n\\n24. BOILED KOHLRABI.--Persons fond of kohlrabi as a vegetable will\\nundoubtedly prefer it merely boiled and flavored with butter, pepper,\\nand salt. When it is to be cooked in this way, prepare it in the manner\\njust explained. Then put it on to cook in sufficient boiling salted\\nwater to cover it well, and allow it to cook with the cover removed\\nuntil it can be easily pierced with a fork. When sufficiently cooked,\\npour off the water, season to taste with salt and pepper, and add 1\\ntablespoonful of butter for each pint of kohlrabi cooked. Serve hot.\\n\\n25. MASHED KOHLRABI.--As turnips and potatoes are often boiled and then\\nmashed, so kohlrabi makes a very appetizing dish when prepared in this\\nway. Prepare the kohlrabi and cook it by boiling. When it has cooked\\nsoft, drain off the water and mash with a wooden or a wire potato\\nmasher. Season with salt and pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter\\nfor each pint of cooked vegetable. Serve hot.\\n\\n26. CREAMED KOHLRABI.--The preparation of kohlrabi can be varied by\\nserving it with a cream sauce. Such a sauce also increases the food\\nvalue of this vegetable by supplying the substances in which it is low.\\n\\nCREAMED KOHLRABI\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n4 c. diced kohlrabi\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n\\nCook the kohlrabi in boiling salted water until tender and then drain\\nthe water from it. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, salt,\\nand pepper, and into this stir the hot milk. Cook until the sauce has\\nthickened. Then pour it over the kohlrabi and reheat. Serve hot.\\n\\n LENTILS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n27. LENTILS are the flattish, circular, dried seeds of an annual vine\\ngrown chiefly in Europe and Asia. They belong to the class of vegetables\\nknown as legumes, and are therefore high in protein in the form of\\nlegumin. They also contain a large amount of carbohydrate in the form of\\nstarch and are high in mineral salts. Because of their high food value,\\nwhich is somewhat over 1,600 calories to the pound, they are a valuable\\nfood in the diet, particularly as a meat substitute. Consequently, when\\nlentils can be obtained at a reasonable price, it is wise to make\\nconsiderable use of them.\\n\\nThere are three varieties of lentils, _yellow_, _red_, and _black_, and\\nthey resemble split peas in appearance, as will be observed from Fig. 6,\\nwhich shows a panful of dried lentils. They have a distinctive flavor\\nthat is agreeable to most persons. However, like other dried legumes,\\nlong cooking is required to make them tender and palatable.\\n\\n28. COOKING OF LENTILS.--In general, the preparation of lentils is\\nsimilar to that of dried beans, the cooking of which is now thoroughly\\nunderstood. They may be put on to cook immediately after they are\\nwashed, but, as in the case of dried beans, their cooking may be\\nhastened if they are first softened by soaking them in cold water for 8\\nto 12 hours. At the end of this time, it is advisable to parboil the\\nlentils for about 10 or 15 minutes, or until their outer skins begin to\\ncrack, in water to which a pinch of soda has been added. This water\\nbeing poured off, the lentils should be washed and then put to cook in\\nfresh water to which 1 teaspoonful of salt is added for each quart of\\nwater used. Like beans, the lentils should be cooked slowly until they\\nare soft enough to crush between the fingers. With these principles for\\nthe cooking of lentils well in mind, the housewife will have no\\ndifficulty in preparing this vegetable, for almost any of the recipes\\ngiven for dried beans may be used with lentils substituted for\\nthe beans.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]  29. LENTIL PUFF.--A decided change from the\\nusual ways of preparing lentils can be had by making lentil puff. Black\\nlentils are used for this preparation, and they are made into a pur\\u00e9e\\nbefore being used in the puff. If the accompanying recipe is carefully\\nfollowed, a most appetizing, as well as nutritious, dish will be\\nthe result.\\n\\nLENTIL PUFF\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1-1/4 c. lentil pur\\u00e9e\\n1-1/2 c. riced potatoes\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/2 c. milk\\n1-1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 eggs\\n\\nSoak the lentils overnight in water that contains a pinch of soda,\\nparboil them for about 10 minutes, and pour off the water. Put them to\\ncook in cold water and cook until they are tender, allowing the water to\\nevaporate completely, if possible, so that the pur\\u00e9e made from them will\\nbe dry. However, if any water remains when the lentils are done, pour it\\noff and use it for soup or sauce. Make the pur\\u00e9e by forcing the cooked\\nlentils through a colander. If it is found to be too wet, less milk can\\nbe used than the recipe calls for. Cook several potatoes and rice them\\nby forcing them through a colander or a ricer. Combine the lentils and\\npotatoes, and to this mixture add the butter, milk, salt, and pepper.\\nSeparate the eggs, and beat the yolks slightly and the whites until\\nstiff. Stir the yolks into the mixture and, just before putting the puff\\ninto the oven, fold in the whites. Pour into a buttered baking dish, set\\nin the oven, and bake until the puff is set and the surface is brown.\\nServe hot.\\n\\n\\nMUSHROOMS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n30. Mushrooms are not a vegetable; still they are included in this\\nSection because they are used like a vegetable. In reality, they are a\\nfungus growth containing no chlorophyl, or green coloring matter, and,\\nas shown in Fig. 7, consisting of an erect stalk that supports a\\ncap-like expansion. They occur in many varieties, both poisonous and\\nnon-poisonous. The non-poisonous, or edible, mushrooms are found on\\nrich, moist pastures all over the world and they are also very\\nfrequently cultivated. They may be collected in almost any locality, but\\nno person who is not perfectly familiar with their characteristics and\\ntherefore able to judge the non-poisonous kinds from the poisonous\\nshould attempt to gather them. Fresh mushrooms can usually be found in\\nthe markets, but as they are expensive, they should be considered a\\nluxury and used only occasionally. Instead, some of the small canned\\nvarieties, which are usually satisfactory for most purposes, should be\\nused when mushrooms are desired and the wild ones cannot be secured.\\n\\n31. In food value, mushrooms are not very high, being about equal to\\nbeets or carrots in this respect; but they have a higher percentage of\\nprotein than these vegetables and they contain extractives similar to\\nthose found in meat. To increase their food value, mushrooms are often\\ncombined with other foods, such as peas, chestnuts, diced meats, and\\nfowl, and made into dishes of various sorts. Then, again, they are\\nserved as a garnish with steaks and other meat dishes. In short, if they\\ncan be secured from the surrounding neighborhood or the price is not\\nprohibitive, they should be used in the many excellent ways that are\\ndevised for their preparation.\\n\\n32. PREPARATION FOR COOKING.--To prepare mushrooms for cooking, clean\\nthem by brushing them carefully with a soft brush, by scraping the\\nsurface, and, in some cases, by removing the stems. Do not, however,\\nthrow the stems away, for they may be used as well as the caps. If the\\nmushrooms are found to be tough, the skin should be peeled off. After\\nbeing thus prepared, mushrooms may be cooked in various ways, as is\\nexplained in the accompanying recipes. [Illustration: FIG. 7]\\n\\n33. BROILED MUSHROOMS.--One of the simplest methods of cooking mushrooms\\nis to broil them. This may be done either by exposing them directly to\\nthe heat or by pan-broiling them. In this recipe, only the caps\\nare used.\\n\\nClean the mushrooms that are to be broiled and remove the stems. Place\\nthe caps in a broiler that has been greased or in a slightly greased\\nfrying pan. Brown them on one side, then turn them and brown them on the\\nother side. Remove to a platter, dot with butter, season with salt and\\npepper, and serve.  34. STEWED MUSHROOMS.--Another very simple way in\\nwhich to cook mushrooms is to stew them and then serve them on toast.\\nWhen prepared by this method, both the stems and the caps are utilized.\\n\\nClean the mushrooms and cut both the caps and the stems into small\\npieces. Cook until tender in sufficient water, stock, or milk to cover\\nthem well, and then season with salt and pepper. To the liquid that\\nremains, add enough flour to thicken it slightly. Serve on toast.\\n\\n35. SAUT\\u00c9D MUSHROOMS.--When mushrooms are saut\\u00e9d, they are often used\\nwith other dishes, particularly broiled steak, to improve the flavor and\\ngive variety. In fact, steak smothered with mushrooms is considered a\\nluxury. However, saut\\u00e9d mushrooms are very frequently served alone or,\\ntogether with a sauce made from the fat in which they are cooked, they\\nare served on toast.\\n\\nClean the mushrooms, remove the stems, and dredge both stems and caps\\nwith flour. Melt fat in the frying pan and place the dredged mushrooms\\nin it. Saut\\u00e9 until brown on both sides and season with salt, pepper, and\\nchopped parsley. Serve in any desired manner. If sauce is desired, add\\nwater or stock to the flour and fat that remain in the frying pan, and\\nallow this to cook for a few minutes.\\n\\n36. CREAMED MUSHROOMS AND CHESTNUTS.--No more delightful combination can\\nbe imagined than mushrooms and chestnuts. When combined with a cream\\nsauce and served in patty shells or timbale cases, a dish suitable for\\nthe daintiest meal is the result. Another very attractive way in which\\nto serve this combination is to place it in a baking dish, or, as shown\\nin Fig. 8, in individual baking dishes, cover it with a layer of biscuit\\nor pastry crust, bake, and serve it as a pie.\\n\\nCREAMED MUSHROOMS AND CHESTNUTS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Eight)\\n\\n1-1/2 c. stewed chestnuts\\n1-1/2 c. stewed mushrooms\\n3 Tb. butter\\n3 Tb. flour\\n1-1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1-1/2 c. milk\\n\\nRemove the shells from the required number of Italian chestnuts and\\ncook the nut meats in boiling water until tender. Peel off the skins and\\nbreak the chestnuts into pieces. If fresh mushrooms are used, stew them\\nin boiling water until tender. Cut the stewed or canned mushrooms into\\npieces of the same size as the chestnuts, and mix the two together. Make\\na cream sauce by melting the butter, adding the flour, salt, and pepper,\\nand stirring in the hot milk. Cook until the mixture thickens, pour it\\nover the chestnuts and mushrooms, and serve in any of the ways\\nsuggested.\\n\\n\\nOKRA AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9]\\n\\n37. OKRA is a fruit vegetable consisting of a green pod that is several\\ninches long, pointed at one end, and filled with seeds. Fig. 9 shows\\nokra pods attached to the herb of which they are a part. Although okra\\noriginated in Africa, it is for the most part grown in the southern\\nsection of the United States. However, canned okra may be obtained\\nalmost anywhere. Okra is low in food value, being only slightly higher\\nthan cabbage and most of the greens; nevertheless, it is liked by many\\npersons. It is of a mucilaginous, or gummy, consistency, and if it is\\nnot properly cooked it becomes very slimy and is then decidedly\\nunpleasant. Because of its gummy nature, it helps to thicken any dish to\\nwhich it is added. Probably its chief use is as an ingredient in soups,\\nwhen it is known as _gumbo_. Chicken gumbo soup is one of the most\\npopular dishes of this kind.  The preliminary preparation of okra is\\nthe same as that of most other vegetables; that is, the pods should be\\nwashed, the stems removed, and the cleaned pods then cooked in\\nsufficient boiling salted water to cover them well.\\n\\n38. STEWED OKRA.--The simplest way in which to prepare okra is to stew\\nit. When seasoned well with salt, pepper, and butter, stewed okra finds\\nmuch favor with those who care for this vegetable.\\n\\nSelect the required number of okra pods and put them on to cook in\\nenough boiling salted water to cover them well. Cook until the pods are\\nsoft enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Season with pepper and, if\\nnecessary, additional salt, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each\\nfour persons to be served.\\n\\n39. OKRA WITH TOMATOES.--If one does not desire a dish made entirely of\\nokra, it may be combined with tomatoes. Such a combination, seasoned\\nwell and flavored with ham or bacon fat, makes a very tasty dish.\\n\\nOKRA WITH TOMATOES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1-1/2 c. stewed or canned okra\\n1-1/2 c. stewed or canned tomatoes\\n1-1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. ham or bacon fat\\n\\nHeat the okra and tomatoes together in a saucepan and add the salt,\\npepper, and ham or bacon fat. Cook for 5 or 10 minutes or until well\\nblended. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nONIONS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\nVARIETIES OF THE ONION FAMILY\\n\\n40. ONIONS are the chief commercial vegetable of the bulb crops. They\\nhave been cultivated from the earliest times, their native country being\\nCentral Asia. Closely allied to the onion are several other bulb\\nvegetables, including garlic, shallots, leeks, and chives, all of which\\nare used more extensively for flavoring dishes than for any other\\npurpose. Fig. 10 shows several varieties of this family, the group of\\nthree in the upper right corner being garlic; the bunch in the lower\\nright corner, leeks; the bunch in the lower left corner, green onions;\\nand the remainder of those shown in the illustration, different\\nvarieties of dried onions, that is, onions that have been allowed\\nto mature.\\n\\n41. This entire class of food is characterized by a typical, volatile\\noil, which in most cases is so strong as to be somewhat irritating and\\nwhich causes the vegetable to disagree with many persons. This flavor,\\nhowever, can be almost entirely dissipated by cooking, so that many\\npersons who cannot eat the various members of the onion family raw can\\ntolerate them cooked. In food value, which is found principally as\\ncarbohydrate in the form of sugar, this class of foods is not very high,\\nbeing about the same as carrots, beets, and other root vegetables. Some\\npersons believe that onions have wonderful medicinal value in curing\\ncolds and preventing them, but there is really no foundation for such\\na belief.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\\n\\n42. ONIONS.--As has been pointed out, onions are of two general\\nvarieties, dried and green. _Dried onions_, as shown in Fig. 10, are\\nthose which have been allowed to grow to maturity and have then been\\ncured, or dried, to a certain extent. Such onions are in demand at all\\nseasons. _Green onions_, also shown in Fig. 10, are those which are\\npulled, or taken out of the ground, before they have matured and are\\neaten while fresh. They are especially popular in the spring, although\\nthey have a rather long season. Each of these classes has many\\nvarieties, which vary in flavor and in color, some of the dried ones\\nbeing yellow, some red, and others white. All dried onions have\\nexcellent keeping qualities, so, after purchasing, no special care need\\nbe given to them except to store them in a comparatively cool, dry\\nplace. Deterioration is due chiefly to sprouting, for as soon as the new\\nplant begins to grow from the center of the onion, the remainder becomes\\nsoft and loses much of its flavor. The green, immature onions, however,\\nwill not keep for any length of time, and in order to keep them fresh\\nuntil they are used, they must be stored in a cool, damp place.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11]\\n\\n43. GARLIC.--The variety of onion known as garlic is very much desired\\nby the people of southern Europe, where it originated. As Fig. 10 shows,\\nit resembles the onion in appearance, but it consists of several parts,\\nor small bulbs, called _cloves_, which are encased in a covering of thin\\nwhite skin. Garlic has a very strong penetrating odor and a biting taste\\nthat resemble the odor and taste of onion, but that are much ranker. It\\nis little used by Americans except as a flavoring for salads and various\\nkinds of highly seasoned meats. In reality, a very small amount of\\ngarlic is sufficient to lend enough flavor, and so the bowl in which a\\nsalad is served is often merely rubbed with garlic before the salad is\\nput into it. No difficulty will be experienced in recognizing garlic in\\nthe markets, for here it is found in long strings that are made by\\nbraiding the dry stems together.\\n\\n44. SHALLOTS.--Closely allied to garlic are shallots, which are native\\nto Syria, where they still grow wild. They are said to have been brought\\ninto Europe by the Crusaders. The bulbs of this vegetable are similar to\\nthose of garlic, being compound in form, but instead of being enclosed\\nin a thin covering, they are separate when mature, as Fig. 11 shows.\\nShallots have a strong flavor, but it is not so rank as that of garlic,\\nnor does the odor remain in the mouth so long as that of onion. Many\\npersons like shallots for flavoring stews, soups, salads, and pickles.\\n\\n45. LEEKS.--Another member of the onion family that is more highly\\nprized and more extensively raised in Europe than in the United States\\nis leeks. As Fig. 10 shows, leeks do not produce a bulb as do onions. In\\nthis vegetable, the lower parts of the leaves grow close together and\\nform a bulb-like stem, or neck, which is fairly solid and which\\nconstitutes the edible part. The odor and flavor of leeks are similar to\\nthose of onions, but they are somewhat weaker. The fleshy stem may be\\nbleached by banking it with earth, and when this is done, the flavor\\nbecomes more mild and the texture more tender than in the onion bulb.\\nLike shallots, leeks are used to flavor stews, soups, and similar foods.\\n\\n46. CHIVES.--The member of the onion family known as chives is a small\\nplant whose roots remain in the ground for many years and produce year\\nafter year dense tufts of slender, hollow leaves. These leaves grow to a\\nheight of about 6 or 8 inches and resemble the tops of onions except\\nthat they are much smaller. Chives, which have a more delicate flavor\\nthan onions, are much used for flavoring soup, stews, salads, meats, and\\nother vegetables and as a garnish for salads. When used for any of these\\npurposes, they are cut into tiny pieces.\\n\\n\\nPREPARATION OF ONIONS\\n\\n47. ONIONS FOR FLAVORING.--When only the flavor of onions is desired in\\na salad or a cooked dish of some sort, such as a dressing for fowl,\\nhash, or any similar combination of food ingredients, the onion should\\nbe added in the form of juice and pulp rather than in pieces. Then it\\nwill not be possible to observe the onion when it is mixed with the food\\nnor to come across small pieces of it when the food is eaten. To prepare\\nan onion in this way, peel it, cut off a crosswise slice, and then grate\\nthe onion on a grater over a shallow dish. Add the juice and pulp thus\\nobtained to any food that calls for onion as a flavoring.\\n\\n48. ONIONS FOR THE TABLE.--When onions are to be used as a vegetable for\\nthe table, they require cooking, but first of all they must be peeled.\\nThis is at best a rather unpleasant task, because the fumes from the\\nstrong volatile oil are irritating to both the eyes and the nostrils.\\nHowever, it may be done more comfortably by keeping the onions immersed\\nin cold water during the peeling. Remove only the dry outside shells,\\nand, if the onions are large, cut them in halves or quarters. However,\\nas the various layers are likely to fall apart when the onion is cut, it\\nis advisable to select medium-sized or small onions, for these may be\\ncooked whole. After the onions have been peeled, they may be cooked in a\\nvariety of ways.\\n\\n49. BOILED ONIONS.--Perhaps the simplest method of cooking onions is to\\nboil them. To allow the strong volatile oil to escape instead of being\\nreabsorbed by the onions, and thus improve the flavor of the onions, the\\ncover should be kept off the vessel while they are cooking. The water in\\nwhich this vegetable is cooked has not a very agreeable flavor, so no\\nuse should be made of it.\\n\\nPeel the desired number of onions and if necessary cut them into halves\\nor quarters. Place them in sufficient boiling water to cover well. Cook\\nin an uncovered vessel until tender enough to be easily pierced with a\\nfork, but not so soft as to fall apart. Then pour off the water, season\\nwith more salt, if necessary, and a little pepper, and add 1\\ntablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Serve hot.\\n\\n50. CREAMED ONIONS.--A cream sauce added to onions makes a very\\nappetizing dish. In fact, most persons prefer creamed onions to any\\nother method of preparation.\\n\\nCREAMED ONIONS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 pt. stewed onions\\n3 Tb. butter\\n3 Tb. flour\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1-1/2 c. hot milk\\n\\nPrepare the onions according to the directions given in Art. 49. When\\nthey are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork, drain. Melt the\\nbutter, and add the flour, salt, pepper, and hot milk. Cook until the\\nsauce thickens, pour over the stewed onions, heat together for a few\\nminutes, and serve.\\n\\n51. BAKED ONIONS.--If variety in the preparation of onions is desired,\\nbaked onions should be tried. Select medium-sized onions, peel them, and\\nthen boil them whole in boiling salted water until they are almost\\ntender. Drain off the water, place the onions in a shallow dish, brush\\nwith butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in a hot oven and\\nbake until brown on one side; then turn them and brown on the other\\nside. Serve hot.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 12]  52. STUFFED ONIONS.--When large onions can be\\nsecured, a very appetizing as well as attractive dish can be prepared by\\nstuffing them and then baking them brown. Onions cooked in this way will\\nappear as shown in Fig. 12.\\n\\nSTUFFED ONIONS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 large onions\\n1 c. dried bread crumbs\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n1/2 tsp. celery salt\\n1/4 c. milk\\n\\nPeel the onions and cook them in boiling salted water until almost\\ntender. Remove from the water and take out the inner portions of the\\nonions, leaving the outside layers in the shape of a cup. Chop the\\nportions of the onions which have been removed and mix with the bread\\ncrumbs. Melt the butter, add to it the chopped onion, bread crumbs,\\nsalt, pepper, and celery salt, and stir all together for a few minutes\\nover the flame. Add the milk, and if the 1/4 cupful is not sufficient to\\nmake the stuffing moist, add more. Fill the onion shells with the\\nstuffing, place in a hot oven, and bake until brown. Serve immediately.\\n\\n\\nPARSNIPS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n53. Parsnips are an important root vegetable, being closely allied to\\ncarrots. They are used to a certain extent during the summer when they\\nare immature, but generally they are allowed to mature so that they may\\nbe stored for use as a winter vegetable. Parsnips have an advantage over\\nmany vegetables in that they have excellent keeping qualities and are\\nparticularly hardy, being able to withstand considerable freezing and\\nthawing when they are left in the ground during the winter. However, as\\nthey grow older, they develop a woody texture, as do beets and turnips,\\nand so at the end of the winter require longer cooking than at the\\nbeginning.\\n\\n54. In food value, parsnips are somewhat higher than other root\\nvegetables, containing a large amount of carbohydrate, which occurs in\\nthe form of sugar. Although they are wholesome and nourishing, they have\\na peculiar, sweetish flavor that is due to the volatile oil they contain\\nand is objectionable to some persons. Still, those who are fond of this\\nflavor find that parsnips afford an excellent opportunity to give\\nvariety to the diet, for they may be prepared in a number of ways, most\\nof which are similar to the ways in which carrots are cooked.\\n\\n55. In preparing parsnips for cooking, scrape them, if possible, instead\\nof peeling them, so as not to waste any of the edible material. Then,\\ntoo, try to obtain medium-sized parsnips, for they will be of much\\nbetter quality than the larger ones. If uneven sizes must be used, the\\nlarger ones should be cut before being cooked, so that they will be\\nsimilar in size to the smaller ones and therefore cook in the same\\nlength of time.\\n\\n56. MASHED PARSNIPS.--A very simple way in which to prepare parsnips is\\nto mash them. Clean and scrape the desired number of parsnips and put\\nthem to cook in sufficient boiling salted water to cover. Cook until\\ntender enough to be pierced with a fork, the length of time required to\\ndo this depending entirely on the age of the parsnips. When tender,\\ndrain off the water and force the parsnips through a colander or a\\nsieve. Season with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve hot.\\n\\n57. CREAMED PARSNIPS.--Parsnips are sometimes cut into dice and then\\nserved with a cream, sauce. When it is desired to prepare them in this\\nway, the accompanying directions should be carefully followed.\\n\\nCREAMED PARSNIPS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. diced parsnips\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 c. milk\\n\\nClean and scrape the parsnips and cut them into dice 1/2 inch in size.\\nPut these to cook in sufficient boiling salted water to cover, cook\\nuntil they may be easily pierced with a fork, and then drain. Melt the\\nbutter in a double boiler, and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Stir in\\nthe hot milk, and cook until the mixture thickens. Pour this sauce over\\nthe parsnips, heat together for a few minutes, and serve.\\n\\n58. BROWNED PARSNIPS.--Parsnips that are browned and sweetened with\\nsugar seem to meet with greater favor than those prepared by other\\nmethods. To prepare them in this way, clean and scrape the desired\\nnumber of parsnips, and slice them in thick slices, or, if they are\\nsmall, cut them in halves lengthwise. Put them to cook in boiling salted\\nwater and cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork, but are not\\ntender enough to fall to pieces. Melt some fat in a frying pan, and\\nplace the slices of cooked parsnips in it. Brown on one side, turn, and\\nthen brown on the other. Sprinkle with a little sugar and, if necessary,\\nadditional salt. Serve.\\n\\n\\nPEAS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n59. In addition to beans and lentils, the class of vegetables called\\nlegumes includes PEAS, which, both green and dried, are used for food.\\nIn composition, there is a decided difference between the two varieties\\nof peas, the green ones being about equal to green corn in food value,\\nand the dried ones having a food value nearly four times as great. In\\neach case, the food substance in the greatest amount is in the form of\\ncarbohydrate. In green peas, this is in the form of sugar, while in\\ndried ones it is changed into starch. Peas also contain protein in the\\nform of legumin, there being three times as much of this substance in\\ndried peas as in green ones. The amount found in green peas is\\nsufficient to be of importance in the diet, but the percentage of this\\nsubstance is so great in dried peas that they may be used very\\nsatisfactorily as a meat substitute.\\n\\n60. GREEN PEAS.--Numerous varieties of green peas are found on the\\nmarket. A few of them are cooked in the pods, especially when the peas\\nare very young, and are eaten pods and all, just as are string beans.\\nMost of them, however, are allowed to mature further and only the peas\\nare eaten, the shell being discarded.\\n\\nWhen green peas are purchased, they are always found in the pods. For\\nthe peas to be most satisfactory, the pods should be fresh and green and\\nshould appear to be well filled. Flat-looking pods mean that the peas\\nhave not matured sufficiently. After being purchased, the peas should\\nnot be removed from the pods until they are to be cooked. However, if it\\nis necessary that they stand for any length of time after they are\\nshelled, they should be kept in a cool place in order to prevent them\\nfrom shriveling. Their cooking is similar to that of any other fresh\\nvegetable; that is, they should be cooked in boiling salted water in a\\ncovered vessel until they are tender enough to be easily crushed between\\nthe fingers or pierced with a fork. With this preliminary preparation,\\nthey may be dressed in any desirable manner.\\n\\n61. DRIED PEAS.--Dried peas, because of their nature, require a\\ndifferent kind of preparation from green peas. In fact, their cooking is\\nsimilar to that of dried beans. They require long slow cooking and are\\nimproved if they are first parboiled in water to which a pinch of soda\\nhas been added. They are not used extensively except in the making of\\nsoups or occasionally for a pur\\u00e9e or a souffl\\u00e9, but as they are very\\nhigh in food value and can be used as a meat substitute, they should\\nhave a prominent place in the dietary of most families. Many of the ways\\nin which dried beans and lentils are prepared are fully as applicable in\\nthe case of dried peas.\\n\\n62. GREEN PEAS WITH BUTTER.--When peas are young and tender, no more\\nappetizing way to prepare them can be found than to boil them and then\\nserve them with butter.\\n\\nSelect fresh green peas with full pods, wash in cold water, and remove\\nthe peas from the shells. Put to cook in enough boiling salted water to\\ncover well, and cook until tender. Pour off all but a small amount of\\nthe water, using the part poured off for making soup or sauce. Add 1\\ntablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served, and season\\nwith additional salt if necessary and a dash of pepper. Serve hot.\\n\\n63. GREEN PEAS ENGLISH STYLE.--If the flavor of mint is agreeable, green\\npeas prepared English style will undoubtedly find favor. Cook them as\\nfor green peas with butter, but, at the time the butter is added, add 1\\ntablespoonful of finely chopped fresh mint. Season with additional salt,\\nif necessary, and pepper, allow all to simmer together for a few\\nminutes, and serve.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\\n\\n64. CREAMED PEAS.--A cream sauce adds considerable food value and flavor\\nto green peas. Peas prepared in this way may be served plain, but they\\ncan be made very attractive by serving them in croustades, as shown in\\nFig. 13. As already learned, _croustades_ are cases made from large\\npieces of bread that are cut any desired shape, hollowed out, and then\\ntoasted in a hot oven or on a broiler or fried in deep fat until crisp.\\n\\nCREAMED PEAS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. shelled green peas\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1/2 c. water from peas\\n1/2 c. milk\\n\\nCook the peas in boiling salted water until tender, and then drain the\\nwater from them, retaining 1/2 cupful for the sauce. Melt the butter,\\nadd the flour, salt, and pepper, and stir in the hot liquids. Cook until\\nthe flour has thickened and then pour over the peas. Serve hot, either\\nplain or in croustades.\\n\\n65. PEAS IN TURNIP CUPS.--A somewhat unusual dish can be prepared by\\nmaking cups out of turnips, filling them with peas, and then pouring a\\ncream sauce over the peas. Besides being attractive, this combination\\nmakes a very palatable vegetable dish.\\n\\nSelect a sufficient number of medium-sized white turnips. Wash them\\nthoroughly, and then hollow out the inside of each, leaving cup-shaped\\nshells about 1/4 inch thick. Cook these shells in boiling salted water\\nuntil tender, but not tender enough to break into pieces, and remove\\nfrom the water. Then, according to the directions given in Art. 60, cook\\nenough green peas to fill the cups. When tender, fill the cups with the\\npeas and over them pour a medium white sauce. Serve hot.  66. PEAS\\nPUR\\u00c9E.--Many persons who cannot eat peas because of the coarse outside\\nskins are able to digest them in the form of a pur\\u00e9e. To prepare them in\\nthis way, boil fresh peas in the manner explained in Art. 60. When they\\nare tender, force them through a pur\\u00e9e sieve or a fine-mesh wire sieve.\\nThe pulp will pass through the sieve, but the coarse skins will remain.\\nThe pur\\u00e9e thus made may be used for soup or in the making of a souffl\\u00e9.\\n\\n67. PEAS SOUFFL\\u00c9.--Nothing in the way of peas is more appetizing and at\\nthe same time more easily digested than peas souffl\\u00e9. This may be baked\\nin a large baking dish, or it may be divided and baked in individual\\nbaking dishes.\\n\\nPEAS SOUFFL\\u00c9\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 Tb. butter\\n2 Tb. flour\\n1/2 c. milk\\n1 c. peas pur\\u00e9e\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n2 eggs\\n\\nMelt the butter, stir in the flour, and add the heated milk. Cook until\\nthe mixture thickens and then add the peas pur\\u00e9e, salt, and pepper.\\nSeparate the eggs, beat the yolks and add them to the mixture, and then\\nfold in the stiffly beaten whites. Pour into a well-greased baking dish\\nor individual baking dishes, place in a pan of hot water, and bake in a\\nslow oven until set, or for 30 or 40 minutes. Serve at once.\\n\\n\\nPEPPERS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n68. PEPPERS are one of the fruit vegetables. Some varieties of them are\\ndried and used as a condiment, that is, to season or give relish to\\nfood, but as they are never used as a vegetable, they are not included\\nhere. It is the sweet varieties of peppers which are used as vegetables\\nand to which reference is made in these discussions. They are valuable\\nchiefly for two reasons: to flavor various kinds of dishes, such as\\nentr\\u00e9es, salads, etc., and to make a dish more attractive in appearance\\nbecause of the contrast in color they afford. In food value, they are\\nabout equal to the various greens, but as a rule such small quantities\\nof them are eaten that they cannot be regarded as a food.\\n\\n69. STUFFED PEPPERS.--The usual way of preparing peppers as a vegetable\\nis to stuff them and then bake them, when they will appear as in Fig.\\n14. The stuffing may be made of various kinds of material, such as\\npieces of meat, vegetables, cereals, etc., and so affords an excellent\\nway to utilize left-overs of any of these foods. Two recipes for\\nstuffing are here given, and either one may be used with equally\\ngood results.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\\n\\nTo prepare peppers for stuffing, wash them in cold water and remove the\\ntops by cutting around the peppers a short distance from the stem.\\nRemove the pulp and seeds from the inside, and wash the peppers\\nthoroughly to make sure that no loose seeds remain. Fill with the\\ndesired stuffing, place in a shallow pan with a small amount of water,\\nand bake until the peppers are soft enough to be pierced with a fork.\\nThe water permits the peppers to steam during the first part of the\\ncooking. Serve hot.\\n\\nSTUFFING NO. 1\\n(Sufficient for Six Peppers)\\n\\n2 Tb. ham fat\\n1 small chopped onion\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1-1/2 c. steamed rice\\n1/2 c. bread crumbs\\n1/2 c. finely chopped boiled ham\\nMilk\\n\\nMelt the fat in a frying pan, add the onion, salt, and pepper, and heat\\ntogether for several minutes. Add the rice, bread crumbs, and ham, and\\nmoisten with milk until the mixture is of the right consistency. Use to\\nfill the peppers.\\n\\nSTUFFING NO. 2\\n(Sufficient for Six Peppers)\\n\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1 onion, chopped\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n2 c. stale bread crumbs\\n2 Tb. chopped parsley\\n1 tsp. celery salt\\nMilk\\n\\nMelt the butter in a frying pan, add the chopped onion, salt, and\\npepper, and heat together. To this add the bread crumbs, chopped\\nparsley, and celery salt, and moisten with enough milk to make the\\nstuffing of the right consistency. Use to stuff peppers.\\n\\n\\nPOTATOES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\nWHITE POTATOES\\n\\n70. WHITE POTATOES, popularly called _Irish potatoes_ because they are a\\nstaple food in Ireland, belong to the class of tuber vegetables. They\\nform such an extensive part of the diets of the majority of people that\\nthey are generally considered the most important vegetable used by\\ncivilized man. They are usually roundish or oblong in shape and have a\\nwhitish interior and a darker colored skin.\\n\\n71. FOOD VALUE OF POTATOES.--In food value, Irish potatoes are\\ncomparatively high, being in this respect about two and one-half times\\nas great as an equal weight of cabbage, but not quite twice as great as\\nthe various root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, etc. The largest\\namount of this food value occurs as carbohydrate in the form of starch,\\nthere being almost no fat and very little protein in potatoes. The\\nstarch granules of potatoes are larger than the starch granules of any\\nof the cereals, the class of foods highest in this food substance, and\\nit is the proper cooking of this starch that makes potatoes dry and\\nmealy. Potatoes also contain a large amount of mineral salts, much of\\nwhich lies directly under the skin. Therefore, the most economical way\\nin which to prepare potatoes is to cook them with the skins on, for then\\nall of the mineral salts are retained and none of the material\\nis wasted.\\n\\n72. SELECTION OF POTATOES.--The new potato crop begins to come into the\\nmarket during the summer, when potatoes are especially appetizing.\\nHowever, as potatoes can be easily stored and kept very well for a\\nconsiderable time, they form a large part of the winter food supply. If\\nthere is sufficient storage space, it is a wise plan to buy a large\\nenough supply of potatoes in the fall to last for several months and\\nthen to store them for the winter. However, when this is done, care\\nshould be taken in the selection.\\n\\nIn the first place, the outside skin should be smooth and not scaly.\\nThen, if possible, potatoes of medium size should be selected, rather\\nthan small ones or large ones. The small ones are not so satisfactory,\\nbecause of the greater proportion of waste in peeling, while the very\\nlarge ones are apt to have a hollow space in the center. To judge the\\nquality of potatoes, a few of those to be purchased should be secured\\nand cooked before a large number of them are bought. The soil and\\nclimatic conditions affect the quality of potatoes to such an extent\\nthat a particular kind of potato which may have been excellent last year\\nmay be entirely different in quality this year. A housewife cannot,\\ntherefore, be guided entirely by her previous knowledge of a certain\\nkind of potato.\\n\\n73. CARE OF POTATOES.--Potatoes bought in quantity should be kept in a\\ncool place and should be excluded from the light. Such care will usually\\nprevent them from discoloring and sprouting. In case they should sprout,\\nthe sprouts should be removed at once, for the potatoes will deteriorate\\nrapidly with such a growth. If the potatoes freeze, they may be thawed\\nby putting them in cold water. Such potatoes, which are characterized by\\na peculiar sweetish taste, should be used as soon as possible after\\nbeing thawed.\\n\\n74. PREPARATION OF POTATOES.--As has already been explained, the most\\neconomical way in which to cook potatoes is with the skins on. However,\\nwhen it is desired to remove the skins, they should be taken off as\\nthinly as possible. New potatoes may be scraped, but completely matured\\npotatoes that have been out of the ground for some time do not scrape\\neasily and so should be pared thinly.\\n\\nPotatoes lend themselves to various methods of cookery, and this is\\nwell, for although this is a food of which most persons do not tire\\neasily, variety in the preparation of a vegetable so commonly used as\\nthe Irish potato is very much to be desired. When cooked in the skins,\\npotatoes may be boiled, baked, or steamed. When the skins are removed,\\npotatoes may be cooked in these ways, as well as fried, saut\\u00e9d,\\nscalloped, creamed, etc.\\n\\n75. BOILED POTATOES.--Without doubt, potatoes are cooked more often by\\nboiling than by any other method, for besides being eaten in this way a\\ngreat deal, they must first be boiled for many of the more elaborate\\nmethods of preparation. If the skins are removed before boiling, the\\nwater in which the potatoes are cooked contains a quantity of starch and\\na great deal of soluble mineral matter that are lost from the potatoes.\\nUse should therefore be made of this liquid, it being very satisfactory\\nfor soups, sauces, and the liquid required in bread making.\\n\\nWhen potatoes are to be boiled, select the desired number of\\nmedium-sized potatoes, and wash them in cold water. If desired, remove\\nthe peelings with a sharp paring knife, but if the potatoes are to be\\ncooked with the skins on, scrub them thoroughly with a vegetable brush\\nin order to remove all dirt. Put to cook in a sufficient amount of\\nboiling salted water to cover well, and cook until the potatoes are\\ntender enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Usually the kettle in\\nwhich potatoes are cooked is covered, but if desired they may be cooked\\nin an uncovered vessel. When done, drain the water from the potatoes and\\nserve at once or use for some of the other methods of preparation.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\\n\\n76. MASHED POTATOES.--If mashed potatoes are prepared properly, they are\\nmuch relished by the majority of persons. However, to be most\\nsatisfactory, they should be cooked long enough not to be lumpy and\\nthen, after being mashed and softened with milk, they should be beaten\\nuntil they are light and creamy.\\n\\nPeel the desired number of potatoes and boil them according to the\\ndirections given in Art. 75. When they are tender, remove them from the\\nfire and drain off the water. Mash the potatoes with a wooden or a wire\\npotato masher, being careful to reduce all the particles to a pulpy mass\\nin order to prevent lumps. However, the preferable way to mash them is\\nto force them through a ricer, when they will appear as shown in Fig.\\n15, for then, if they are thoroughly cooked, there will be no danger of\\nlumps. When they are sufficiently mashed, season with additional salt, a\\ndash of pepper, and a small piece of butter, and add hot milk until they\\nare thinned to a mushy consistency, but not too soft to stand up well\\nwhen dropped from a spoon. Then beat the potatoes vigorously with a\\nlarge spoon until they become light and fluffy. Serve at once.\\n\\n77. BAKED POTATOES.--A very nutritious vegetable dish results when\\npotatoes are baked. For this method of cooking potatoes, those of medium\\nsize are better than large ones; also, if the potatoes are uniform in\\nsize, all of them will bake in the same length of time. It is well to\\nchoose for baking, potatoes that are smooth and unblemished, in order\\nthat they may be prepared without cutting the skins. As the starchy\\nparticles of the potato are cooked by the heated water inside the\\npotato, the cooking cannot be done so successfully when the skin is cut\\nor marred, for then the water will evaporate.\\n\\nPrepare the potatoes by scrubbing them thoroughly; then place them on a\\nshallow pan and set them in the oven or place them directly on the oven\\ngrate. The temperature of the oven is important in baking potatoes. If\\nit is too hot, the skins of the potatoes will become charred, and if it\\nis not hot enough, too long a time will be required for the baking. The\\ntemperature found to produce the best results is about 400 degrees\\nFahrenheit, or the same as that for the baking of bread. Turn the\\npotatoes once or twice during the baking, so that they will bake evenly.\\nAllow them to bake until it is possible to pierce them to the center\\nwith a fork or they are soft enough to dent easily when pinched with the\\ntips of the fingers. The latter is the preferable test, for when the\\npotato is pierced, so much of the moisture is lost that it is not likely\\nto be of the best quality when served. Upon removing from the oven,\\nserve at once. Baked potatoes become soggy upon standing. If desired,\\nthey may be rolled to soften the contents of the shell and then cut open\\non one side, and pepper, salt, and paprika put into the potato.\\n\\nThe length of time required for baking potatoes is usually 10 to 15\\nminutes longer than is necessary to cook potatoes of the same size in\\nwater. However, the time for baking may be decreased by boiling the\\npotatoes for about 5 minutes before they are put in the oven. In such an\\nevent, the boiling and the baking should be accomplished in about\\n35 minutes.\\n\\n78. STUFFED POTATOES.--An attractive way in which to serve baked\\npotatoes is shown in Fig. 16. After the potatoes are thoroughly baked,\\nthe contents are removed, treated as mashed potatoes, and then stuffed\\ninto the shells and set in the oven to brown for a few minutes. When\\nsomething different in the way of potatoes is desired, stuffed potatoes\\nshould be tried.\\n\\nBake the desired number of potatoes until tender. Remove from the oven,\\ncut through the skin of each from end to end with a sharp knife, and\\nscrape out the contents of the shell. Mash the pulp according to the\\ndirections given in Art. 76. Then fill the shells with the mashed\\npotatoes, allowing the surface to stand up roughly, as shown, instead of\\nsmoothing it down. Dot each with butter, sprinkle a little paprika over\\nthe tops, and replace in the oven. Bake until the surface is nicely\\nbrowned and then serve at once.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16]\\n\\n79. BROWNED POTATOES.--While not so easy to digest as boiled or baked\\npotatoes, browned potatoes offer an opportunity for a change from the\\nusual ways of preparing this vegetable. They may be prepared on the\\nstove or in the oven, but when browned in the oven the surface is more\\nlikely to be tough.\\n\\nBoil the desired number of potatoes, and when they are sufficiently\\ntender, drain off the water. If they are to be saut\\u00e9d on the stove, melt\\na small amount of fat in a frying pan, and place the cooked potatoes in\\nit. Saut\\u00e9 until brown on one side, then turn and brown on the other.\\nSeason with additional salt, if necessary, and serve.\\n\\nIn case it is desired to brown them in the oven, put the boiled potatoes\\nin a shallow pan and brush them over with butter. Set them in a hot\\noven, allow them to brown on one side, then turn and brown them on the\\nother. Season with salt, if necessary, and serve at once upon removing\\nfrom the oven.  80. RAW SAUT\\u00c9D POTATOES.--If a potato dish suitable for\\nsupper or luncheon is desired, raw potatoes may be sliced thin, as at\\n_a_, Fig. 17, and then saut\\u00e9d. For this purpose, small potatoes that are\\nnot suitable for other methods of preparation may be used.\\n\\nPeel the potatoes and slice them into thin slices. Melt a small amount\\nof fat in a frying pan, place the potatoes in the hot fat, and cover the\\npan. Allow them to steam in this way for 10 to 15 minutes and then\\nremove the cover. Brown on one side; then turn and brown on the other.\\nSeason with salt and pepper.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17]\\n\\n81. HASH-BROWNED POTATOES.--A very good way in which to use up boiled\\npotatoes is to hash-brown them in the oven.\\n\\nHASH-BROWNED POTATOES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 medium-sized cooked potatoes\\n1-1/2 tsp. salt\\n2 Tb. butter\\n3 Tb. milk\\n1/4 tsp. pepper\\n\\nSlice or chop the cold potatoes, place in a buttered pan, add the salt\\nand pepper, melt the butter, and pour it over them. Place in a hot oven\\nuntil nicely browned. Stir, add the milk, and brown again. Stir again,\\nbrown the third time, and serve.\\n\\n82. POTATO PATTIES.--Mashed potatoes, whether left over or boiled and\\nmashed especially for the purpose, may be made up into patties and then\\nsaut\\u00e9d until brown on both sides.\\n\\nPOTATO PATTIES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. mashed potato\\n1 egg\\nFine bread crumbs\\n\\nTo the mashed potatoes that have been well seasoned, add the egg and\\nmix thoroughly. Shape into flat, round patties and roll in the bread\\ncrumbs. Melt fat in a frying pan, place the patties in it, saut\\u00e9 on one\\nside until brown, and then turn and brown on the other side. Serve hot.\\n\\n83. FRENCH FRIED POTATOES.--Many families are deprived of French fried\\npotatoes because the majority of housewives think they are difficult to\\nprepare. This, however, is not the case, for when the procedure is\\nunderstood nothing is easier.\\n\\nPeel the required number of potatoes and cut them into the desired\\nshape. Great variety exists in the method of cutting potatoes for this\\npurpose. However, the form that is usually thought of when French fried\\npotatoes are mentioned is the one obtained by cutting the potatoes into\\npieces like the sections of an orange and then cutting these sections\\nlengthwise into smaller pieces, like those shown at _b_, Fig. 17. Pieces\\nlike those shown at _c_, called _shoestring potatoes_, are also popular.\\nAs soon as cut, in no matter what shape, drop the pieces into cold\\nwater, but when ready to fry, remove them from the water and dry on a\\nclean dry towel. Place in a wire basket and lower the basket into a pan\\nof hot fat. Fry until the potatoes are nicely browned, remove from the\\nfat, drain, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve at once.\\n\\n84. POTATOES AU GRATIN.--Something a little unusual in the way of a\\npotato dish is produced when potatoes are combined with cheese, bread\\ncrumbs, and a cream sauce to make potatoes au gratin. In addition to\\nsupplying flavor, these ingredients increase the food value of the\\npotatoes so that a highly nutritious dish is the result.\\n\\nPOTATOES AU GRATIN\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n3 c. diced cooked potatoes\\n1/2 c. grated cheese\\n1/2 c. bread crumbs\\n1-1/2 c. thin white sauce\\n\\nGrease a baking dish, place 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the\\ndish, and sprinkle over them 1/2 of the crumbs and then 1/2 of the\\ncheese. Put the remainder of the potatoes in the dish, sprinkle with the\\nrest of the cheese, pour the hot white sauce over all, and place the\\nremaining crumbs on top. Set the dish in a hot oven and bake until well\\nheated through and brown on top.\\n\\n85. LYONNAISE POTATOES.--When saut\\u00e9d potatoes are flavored with onion\\nand parsley, they are known as Lyonnaise potatoes. As they are very\\nappetizing, potatoes prepared in this way are relished by most persons.\\n\\nLYONNAISE POTATOES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 Tb. butter or ham or bacon fat\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1 medium-sized onion, chopped\\nDash of pepper\\n2 Tb. parsley\\n3 c. diced cooked potatoes\\n\\nMelt the fat in a frying pan, and add the onion, parsley, salt, and\\npepper. When the fat is hot, add the potatoes, which should be diced,\\nlike those shown at _d_, Fig. 17, and allow them to saut\\u00e9 until slightly\\nbrown. Stir frequently to avoid burning. Serve hot.\\n\\n86. SCALLOPED POTATOES.--Many vegetables may be scalloped, but potatoes\\nseem to lend themselves to this form of preparation to good advantage.\\nPotatoes prepared in this way are suitable for luncheon, supper, or a\\nhome dinner.\\n\\nWash and peel the desired number of potatoes and slice them thin. Place\\na layer in the bottom of a well-greased baking dish, sprinkle lightly\\nwith flour, salt, and pepper, and dot with butter. Add another layer of\\npotatoes, sprinkle again with flour, salt, and pepper, and dot with\\nbutter. Continue in this way until the dish is filled. Pour a sufficient\\nquantity of milk over the whole to cover well. Place a cover over the\\ndish, set in a hot oven, and bake for about 1/2 hour. Then remove the\\ncover and allow the potatoes to continue baking until they can be easily\\npierced with a fork and the surface is slightly brown. Serve hot from\\nthe baking dish.\\n\\n87. CREAMED POTATOES.--A very good way in which to utilize left-over\\nboiled potatoes is to dice them and then serve them with a cream sauce.\\nIf no cooked potatoes are on hand and creamed potatoes are desired,\\npotatoes may, of course, be boiled especially for this purpose. When\\nthis is done, it is well to cook the potatoes in the skins, for they\\nremain intact better and have a better flavor.\\n\\nCut up potatoes that are to be creamed into half-inch dice, like those\\nshown at _d_, Fig. 17. Make a thin white sauce, pour it over the\\npotatoes until they are well moistened, and allow the potatoes to simmer\\nin this sauce for a few minutes. If desired, chopped parsley may be\\nadded to the sauce to improve the flavor. Serve hot.\\n\\n88. POTATO BALLS.--If a potato dish is desired for a meal that is to be\\ndainty in every respect, potato balls should be tried. These are small\\nballs of uniform size, like those shown at _e_, Fig. 17, cut from raw\\npotatoes by means of a French cutter, as shown in Fig. 18, cooked until\\ntender, and then dressed with a cream sauce or in any other way. As will\\nbe observed, much of the potato remains after all the balls that can be\\ncut from it are obtained. This should not be wasted, but should be\\nboiled and then mashed or prepared in any other desirable way.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 18]\\n\\nWash and peel the potatoes that are to be used, and then from each\\npotato cut with a French cutter all the balls possible. When a\\nsufficient number have been obtained, boil them until tender in boiling\\nsalted water and then drain. Make a thin cream sauce, add the potatoes\\nto this, and heat together thoroughly. Serve hot.\\n\\n89. POTATO CROQUETTES.--Left-over mashed potatoes can be utilized in no\\nbetter way than to make croquettes. Of course, if potato croquettes are\\ndesired and no potatoes are on hand, it will be necessary to cook\\npotatoes and mash them especially for this purpose. Croquettes made\\naccording to the accompanying recipe will be found a delightful addition\\nto the menu. They are often served plain, but are much improved by a\\nmedium white sauce or a gravy.\\n\\nPOTATO CROQUETTES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. mashed potatoes\\n2 Tb. chopped parsley\\n1 Tb. onion juice\\n1 tsp. celery salt\\n2 eggs\\nDry bread crumbs\\n\\nTo the mashed potatoes, add the parsley, onion juice, and celery salt\\nand mix thoroughly. Beat the eggs slightly, reserve a small amount to be\\ndiluted with water or milk for dipping the croquettes, and add the rest\\nto the potatoes. Shape the mixture into oblong croquettes of uniform\\nsize and shape. Roll each in the crumbs, then in the diluted egg, and\\nagain in the crumbs. Fry in deep hot fat until an even brown in color.\\nRemove from the fat, drain, and serve.  90. POTATO PUFF.--Mashed potato\\ncombined with egg, seasoned well, and baked in the oven makes a very\\nappetizing dish known as potato puff. This is suitable for any meal at\\nwhich potatoes would be served.\\n\\nPOTATO PUFF\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. mashed potato\\n1/2 tsp. celery salt\\n1 egg\\n\\nTo the mashed potato, add the celery salt. Separate the egg, beat the\\nyolk, and mix it with the potato. Beat the white stiff and fold it into\\nthe potato last. Pile into a buttered baking dish, set in a hot oven,\\nand bake until the potato is thoroughly heated through and the surface\\nis brown. Serve at once.\\n\\n\\nSWEET POTATOES\\n\\n91. SWEET POTATOES are used for practically the same purposes as white\\npotatoes, and while these vegetables resemble each other in many\\nrespects they are not related botanically, sweet potatoes being root\\nrather than tuber vegetables. Sweet potatoes are of a tropical nature\\nand have been cultivated for hundreds of years in the West Indies and\\nCentral America. They form a staple article of diet in the southern part\\nof the United States, where, on account of the warm climate, they are\\nraised abundantly. They are not raised in the North; still they are\\nconsumed there in large quantities. After maturing, sweet potatoes are\\ncollected and dried in kilns before shipping. While this makes it\\npossible for them to keep longer than if they were not dried, they do\\nnot keep so well as white potatoes and therefore cannot be stored in\\nsuch large numbers. If they are to be kept for a considerable period of\\ntime, they should be wrapped separately in paper and stored in a cool,\\ndry place.\\n\\n92. Sweet potatoes vary considerably in size, shape, and quality. Some\\nare short and blunt at the tips, others are long and cylindrical, either\\ncrooked or straight, while others are medium in size and spindle-shaped.\\nSome varieties, which are known as _yams_, cook moist and sugary, while\\nothers, which are simply called sweet potatoes, cook dry and mealy. The\\nkind to select depends entirely on the individual taste, for in\\ncomposition and food value all the varieties are similar. In\\ncomposition, sweet potatoes resemble white ones, except that a part of\\ntheir carbohydrate is in the form of sugar, which gives them their\\ncharacteristic sweet taste, but in food value they are almost twice as\\ngreat as white potatoes.\\n\\n93. The preparation of sweet potatoes is similar to that of white\\npotatoes, for they may be boiled, steamed, baked, mashed, creamed,\\nfried, etc. In fact, they may be used at any time to take the place of\\nwhite potatoes in the diet. A few recipes are here given for this\\nvegetable, but any of those given under White Potatoes may also be used\\nby merely substituting sweet potatoes for the white potatoes specified.\\n\\n94. BOILED SWEET POTATOES.--It is a very simple procedure to boil sweet\\npotatoes. When they are to be prepared in this way, select potatoes of\\nuniform size and either remove their skins or cook them with the skins\\non. If they are not peeled, scrub them perfectly clean. Put them to cook\\nin boiling salted water and allow them to boil until they may be easily\\npierced with a fork. Drain the water from them, peel if cooked with\\ntheir skins on, and serve hot with butter or gravy.\\n\\n95. BAKED SWEET POTATOES.--Persons who are fond of sweet potatoes prefer\\nthem baked to any other method of preparation. Select medium-sized\\npotatoes for this purpose, scrub thoroughly, and put in a hot oven to\\nbake. Bake until they are soft enough to dent when pinched between the\\nfingers. Remove from the oven and serve at once.\\n\\n96. GLAZED SWEET POTATOES.--To increase the sweet taste characteristic\\nof sweet potatoes and favored by many persons, a sweet sirup is\\nsometimes added. When this is done, the potatoes are first boiled and\\nthen cut in half lengthwise and saut\\u00e9d. Sweet potatoes so prepared\\nafford a pleasing variety in the diet.\\n\\nClean and peel the desired number of potatoes and boil them as already\\nexplained. Cut them in half lengthwise, so that each piece has a flat\\nside. Melt fat in a frying pan, add the halves of sweet potato, and fry\\nuntil slightly brown. Then turn and fry on the reverse side. About 10 or\\n15 minutes before removing from the pan, pour a small quantity of\\nmolasses or a mixture of sugar and water over the potatoes, and allow\\nthem to cook in this sirup until they are well covered with the sweet\\nsubstance. Remove from the pan and serve at once.  97. MASHED SWEET\\nPOTATOES.--Used alone without further preparation, mashed sweet potatoes\\nmake a very palatable dish. However, as in the case of mashed white\\npotatoes, numerous appetizing dishes, such as croquettes, patties, etc.,\\ncan be made of mashed sweet potatoes, whether left from a previous meal\\nor cooked for this purpose. In the preparation of all such dishes, the\\nrecipes given under White Potatoes may be followed.\\n\\nPeel the desired number of potatoes and cook them in boiling salted\\nwater until they may be readily pierced with a fork. Drain, force\\nthrough a sieve or a ricer, and season with salt, pepper, and a small\\namount of butter. Thin the mixture with sufficient hot milk to make it\\nof a stiff, mush-like consistency. Then beat vigorously until the potato\\nis light and creamy. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nRADISHES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n98. RADISHES are a root vegetable used almost exclusively as a relish or\\nto lend flavor to a vegetable-salad mixture. They are easily and\\nsuccessfully grown and are plentiful and cheap, except when they are out\\nof season and must be raised in hothouses. Numerous varieties of\\nradishes differing from one another in size, shape, and color are\\nraised. The red ones are generally preferred, because they lend color to\\na dish or a meal, but the white and brown varieties are just as\\ndesirable so far as flavor is concerned.\\n\\n99. Radishes contain very little food value, being about equal to celery\\nand cucumbers in this respect. They do not supply anything valuable to a\\nmeal except mineral salts. Although some persons consider radishes\\ndifficult to digest, they contain almost nothing that has to be\\ndigested, for they are composed largely of cellulose, which does not\\ndigest, and water. Radishes disagree with some persons because, like\\nonions and cabbage, they contain a strong volatile oil that gives them\\ntheir flavor.\\n\\n100. Since radishes are always eaten raw, they require very little in\\nthe way of preparation. The principal thing is to see that they are\\nperfectly clean and as crisp as possible. To make them crisp, allow them\\nto stand in cold water for some time before using them. Then remove the\\ntops and the roots and scrub thoroughly with a vegetable brush. The\\nsmall red radishes can be made very attractive by cutting the skin in\\nsections to resemble the petals of a rose. When prepared in this way, a\\nsmall portion of the green top is allowed to remain.\\n\\n\\nSALSIFY AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\n101. SALSIFY is a root vegetable resembling in food value such other\\nroot vegetables as carrots and parsnips. Because it has a flavor similar\\nto that of oysters, especially when it is used for soup, it has received\\nthe name of _vegetable oyster_. It consists of long slender roots that\\nare covered with tiny roots. It is somewhat difficult to clean and\\nprepare, but as it may be stored through the entire winter and is\\nparticularly desirable for the making of soup, it is a valuable\\nvegetable.\\n\\n102. In preparing salsify for cooking, scrape the roots rather than peel\\nthem. Then put them in a solution of cold salt water made by using 1\\nteaspoonful of salt to each quart of water and keep them there until\\nready to cook them. This precaution will, to a certain extent, prevent\\nthe discoloration that always takes place in salsify as soon as the skin\\nis removed. When thus prepared, salsify lends itself to the same forms\\nof preparation as do the other root vegetables.\\n\\n103. BUTTERED SALSIFY.--The simplest way in which to cook salsify is to\\ncut it in thin slices, boil it until tender, and then serve it\\nwith butter.\\n\\nWash and scrape the desired quantity of salsify and slice in thin\\nslices. Put to cook in boiling salted water, and cook until it can be\\neasily pierced with a fork. Drain off the water, season with pepper and,\\nif necessary, additional salt, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for\\neach four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt and serve the\\nsalsify hot.\\n\\n104. CREAMED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--If creamed vegetables are favored,\\nvegetable oysters served with a cream sauce will be very much relished.\\nClean and scrape the salsify and cut it into 1/4-inch slices. Put to\\ncook in boiling salted water, cook until tender, and then drain. Make a\\nmedium white sauce and pour this over the cooked vegetable. Heat\\ntogether and serve.  105. SCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--A very\\nappetizing scalloped dish can be made of salsify by following the\\ndirections given in the accompanying recipe.\\n\\nSCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTERS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n2 c. cooked vegetable oysters\\n1 c. bread crumbs\\nSalt and pepper\\n1-1/2 c. thin white sauce\\n\\nCook the vegetable oysters as explained in Art. 103. Sprinkle a layer of\\ncrumbs in the bottom of a well-greased baking dish, place a layer of the\\ncooked vegetable oysters on top of this, and season with salt and\\npepper. Place a second layer of crumbs and the remainder of the\\nvegetable oysters in the dish, and sprinkle again with salt and pepper.\\nPour the white sauce over this, and put the remainder of the crumbs on\\ntop. Place in a hot oven and bake until well heated through and the top\\nis brown. Serve from the baking dish.\\n\\n\\nSQUASH AND ITS PREPARATION\\n\\nSUMMER SQUASH\\n\\n106. SUMMER SQUASH is a fruit vegetable belonging to the same class as\\neggplant, peppers, etc. and occurring in many varieties. The different\\nkinds of this vegetable vary greatly in size, shape, and color, but all\\nof them may be prepared in practically the same way and used for the\\nsame purposes. They get their name from the fact that they are grown and\\nused during the summer season; in fact, they must be used at this time,\\nfor they do not permit of storage.\\n\\nSummer squash contains a great deal of water, and for this reason its\\nfood value is very low, being about equal to that of lettuce, celery,\\netc. Because of the large percentage of water in its composition, as\\nlittle water as possible should be added in its cooking, or the result\\nwill be a vegetable so watery as to be unattractive and unpalatable.\\nAnother precaution that should be taken in its preparation is to remove\\nthe seeds and the skins. Many housewives think it unnecessary to do\\nthis, for both the skins and the seeds can be eaten after cooking; but\\nmost persons prefer to have them removed, as the dish appears more\\nappetizing.  _Vegetable marrow_ is a type of summer squash and may be\\nprepared for the table by any of the recipes for summer squash.\\n\\n107. STEWED SUMMER SQUASH.--The usual way in which to cook summer squash\\nis to stew it. If properly cooked and well seasoned, stewed squash makes\\na very tasty dish.\\n\\nWash and peel the desired number of summer squashes, remove the seeds,\\nand cut into small pieces. Put over the flame in just enough water to\\nstart the cooking and add sufficient salt to season well. Cook until\\ntender enough to be pierced with a fork and most of the water is boiled\\naway, being careful not to scorch. Remove from the fire, season with\\npepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be\\nserved. Mash until the squash is as fine as desired and serve at once.\\n\\n108. SAUT\\u00c9D SUMMER SQUASH.--For variety, summer squash is sometimes\\nsliced, coated with egg and crumbs, and then saut\\u00e9d until well browned.\\n\\nTo prepare it in this way, wash and peel the squash and cut it into\\nslices about 1/4 inch thick. Roll first in beaten egg diluted with milk\\nor water and then in fine crumbs. Saut\\u00e9 in a small amount of fat in a\\nfrying pan until well browned, and then turn and brown on the other\\nside. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nWINTER SQUASH\\n\\n109. WINTER SQUASH is the kind of squash that may be removed from the\\nvine in the fall and stored for winter use. Although both summer and\\nwinter squashes are closely related, they differ considerably in\\nappearance, flavor, texture, and composition. The different varieties of\\nwinter squash are usually larger than summer squashes and have a very\\nhard outside covering; also, they contain less water and more\\ncarbohydrate and, consequently, have a higher food value. Winter\\nsquashes are usually taken from the vines in the fall before the frost\\nsets in, and before they are placed in storage they are allowed to lie\\nin the sunshine for a few days until the skin hardens and becomes\\nflinty. If the outside covering is unmarred when the squashes are\\nstored, they will remain in good condition almost the entire winter\\nseason, provided the storage place is cool and dry.\\n\\n110. To prepare winter squash for cooking, cut it open, remove the\\nseeds, and peel off the outside skin. Because of the hardness of the\\ncovering, a cleaver or a hatchet is generally required to open the\\nsquash and cut it into pieces. With this done, scrape out the seeds and,\\nwith a very sharp large knife, peel off the skin. The squash may then be\\ncooked in any suitable manner.\\n\\n111. MASHED SQUASH.--If winter squash is desired as a vegetable, it is\\nvery often boiled and then mashed. Squash prepared in this way, with the\\nexception of the seasoning, is also used for pie that is similar to\\npumpkin; in fact, many persons prefer the flavor of squash pie to that\\nof pumpkin pie.\\n\\nCut pieces of peeled winter squash into cubes about 1 inch in size. Put\\nthese to cook in a small amount of boiling water, add enough salt to\\nseason, and cook until tender and quite dry. Season the cooked squash\\nwith pepper, add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be\\nserved, and, if desired to increase the sweet taste, add a small amount\\nof sugar. Mash until smooth and serve hot.\\n\\n112. BAKED SQUASH.--Winter squash, because of its hard covering, is very\\nsatisfactory when baked in the shell, as shown in Fig. 19. If it is not\\ndesired to cook it in a whole piece, the squash may be cut into pieces\\nabout 3 inches square or into triangular pieces.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 19]\\n\\nRemove the seeds from the squash, sprinkle each with salt and pepper,\\nand dot with butter, as shown. Place in a hot oven directly on the grate\\nor in a shallow pan, and bake until the contents of the shells are\\ntender. Remove from the oven, and serve from the shells. If desired, the\\nsquash may be scooped from the shells after baking, seasoned at that\\ntime instead of when put in the oven, and then served in a\\nvegetable dish.\\n\\n TOMATOES AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n113. TOMATOES are a fruit vegetable that may be either cooked or\\nprepared raw in many different ways. They are usually red when ripe, and\\nbecause of this color they are particularly attractive on the table.\\nGreen or partly ripe tomatoes are also used in the preparation of many\\ndishes. Tomatoes are composed largely of water, and for this reason\\ntheir food value is low, being about the same as that of greens. This\\nlarge proportion of water is also responsible for the fact that they do\\nnot keep for a great length of time. Tomatoes, however, have a long\\nseason. They begin to appear in the market early in the spring and they\\nmay be obtained from this time until the frost kills the vines in\\nthe fall.\\n\\n114. While tomatoes appeal to the majority of persons, they disagree\\nwith some on account of the acid they contain. This acid is similar to\\nthat found in some fruits, and it is present in greater quantity in\\ncooked tomatoes than in raw ones, the heating of the vegetable\\napparently increasing the acidity. This acidity of tomatoes may be\\nreduced by the addition of soda, and while soda produces a marked change\\nin the flavor, it is necessary in the preparation of some dishes. For\\ninstance, in the case of cream-of-tomato soup, soda must be added to\\nreduce the acidity and thus keep the milk or cream used in preparing\\nthis dish from curdling.\\n\\n115. The skin of tomatoes, whether they are to be eaten raw or cooked,\\nis usually undesirable. Therefore, in preparing tomatoes for the table,\\nthe skins are generally removed. In order to do this, first dip the\\ntomatoes into boiling water for several seconds and then immediately\\ninto cold water. This will loosen the skins, which may then be peeled\\noff very thinly, and very little of the tomato will be wasted.\\n\\n116. STEWED TOMATOES.--The usual way of preparing tomatoes is to stew\\nthem. Stewed tomatoes may be served plain, but they can be improved very\\ndecidedly by toasting cubes of bread and adding these to the tomatoes\\njust before serving.\\n\\nRemove the skins and stem ends from the desired number of tomatoes, and\\neither cut the tomatoes into pieces or allow them to remain whole. Put\\nto cook with little or no water, as the tomatoes themselves usually\\nprovide sufficient water. Season with salt, and cook until the tomatoes\\nare reduced to a mushy consistency. Just before removing from the stove,\\nadd a dash of pepper and a small amount of butter.\\n\\n117. SCALLOPED TOMATOES.--A very appetizing way in which to cook\\ntomatoes is to scallop them according to the accompanying recipe.\\n\\nSCALLOPED TOMATOES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n1 c. crumbs, buttered\\n2 c. stewed tomatoes\\n1 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n1 Tb. butter\\n\\nGrease a baking dish and place a layer of the crumbs in the bottom.\\nPlace a layer of tomatoes over them, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and\\ndot with the butter. Add another layer of crumbs and the remainder of\\nthe tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and again dot with butter.\\nPlace the remainder of the crumbs on top. Bake in a hot oven until well\\nheated through and the crumbs on top are brown. Serve hot from the\\nbaking dish.\\n\\n118. STUFFED TOMATOES.--Tomatoes prove to be very satisfactory when\\nstuffed with a well-seasoned stuffing and then baked. Medium-sized\\ntomatoes that are firm and unblemished should be selected for stuffing.\\n\\nSTUFFED TOMATOES\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 tomatoes\\n1-1/2 c. crumbs\\n2 Tb. butter\\n1 small onion, chopped\\n1 tsp. celery salt\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\nDash of pepper\\n\\nRemove the stem end from each tomato and scoop out the inside so that a\\nhollow shell remains. Chop the pulp of the tomatoes into small pieces\\nand add the crumbs, melted butter, onion, celery salt, salt, and pepper.\\nMix together thoroughly. If the tomatoes do not furnish enough liquid to\\nmoisten the crumbs, add a little water. Pack the stuffing into the\\ntomatoes, allowing it to heap up on top, and place the tomatoes side by\\nside in a shallow pan. Set in a hot oven and bake until the tomato\\nshells are tender enough to be pierced with a fork and the stuffing is\\nwell heated through. Serve at once.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 20]\\n\\n119. STUFFED TOMATOES WITH CHEESE CARROTS.--An attractive way in which\\nto serve stuffed tomatoes is shown in Fig. 20.  The tomatoes are filled\\nwith a tasty stuffing and then baked. Yellow cream cheese is made to\\nresemble tiny carrots, and these, together with parsley, are used to\\ngarnish the platter in which the tomatoes are placed.\\n\\nSTUFFED TOMATOES WITH CHEESE CARROTS\\n(Sufficient to Serve Six)\\n\\n6 medium-sized tomatoes\\n4 Tb. bacon or ham fat\\n2 Tb. chopped onion\\n1/2 c. chopped ham\\n1-1/2 c. stale bread crumbs\\n1/2 tsp. salt\\n1/8 tsp. pepper\\n2 Tb. chopped parsley\\nYellow cream cheese\\nParsley\\n\\nCut the tops from the tomatoes and remove the pulp. Melt the fat in a\\nfrying pan, add the chopped onion, ham, tomato pulp, bread crumbs, salt,\\npepper, and parsley. Heat thoroughly and mix well. Fill the tomatoes\\nwith the stuffing, which should be quite moist, put them in a shallow\\npan, and bake them until the tomato shell may be easily pierced with a\\nfork. Mash yellow cream cheese and, if necessary, moisten it slightly\\nwith cream. Shape it into tiny carrots with the fingers, and put a piece\\nof parsley in one end for leaves. Place the baked tomatoes on a platter\\nand garnish with the carrots and sprigs of parsley. Serve.\\n\\n120. SAUT\\u00c9D TOMATOES.--Half ripened tomatoes are delicious when saut\\u00e9d.\\nCut the desired number of such tomatoes into slices about 1/4 inch\\nthick, and roll first in beaten egg and then in stale bread crumbs or\\ncracker crumbs. Saut\\u00e9 in a small amount of fat until they are brown on\\none side; then turn and brown on the other side. Remove from the pan and\\nserve at once.\\n\\n121. CREAMED TOMATOES.--A rather unusual, but nevertheless very\\nappetizing, way of preparing tomatoes consists in saut\\u00e9ing them in fat\\nand then serving them with a cream sauce on freshly toasted bread.\\n\\nWhen it is desired to prepare tomatoes in this manner, select\\nmedium-sized ones and cut them into slices 1/2 inch thick. Roll the\\nslices first in egg and then in stale bread crumbs or cracker crumbs.\\nSaut\\u00e9 in a generous amount of fat until brown, drain carefully, and\\nbrown on the other side. When done, remove from the pan. Add 2\\ntablespoonfuls of flour to the fat that remains in the pan, and stir\\nuntil the flour becomes light brown. Add 1-1/2 cupfuls of milk and stir\\nuntil thick. Place the slices of tomato on freshly toasted bread and\\npour the sauce over them.\\n\\n\\nTURNIPS AND THEIR PREPARATION\\n\\n122. TURNIPS, which are a root vegetable, occur in two varieties,\\n_white_ and _yellow_. The white ones are commonly known as _turnips_ and\\nthe yellow ones are called _rutabagas_. Although differing in color,\\nboth varieties have much the same flavor and may be prepared in the same\\nways. Therefore, whenever a recipe calls for turnips, rutabagas may be\\nused as well.\\n\\n123. In food value, turnips are similar to beets, carrots, and parsnips.\\nThey have a strong flavor, which is disliked by many persons and\\ndisagrees with some. However, much of this can be dissipated by cooking\\nthem with the cover of the kettle removed, so that when properly\\nprepared they furnish a pleasant variety to the winter menu. They have\\ngood storing qualities and can be kept very easily through the winter.\\nToward spring it is more difficult to cook them soft, as the cellulose\\nin them becomes harder and they are likely to develop woody fiber.\\n\\n124. In preparing turnips for cooking, scrub them until thoroughly clean\\nand then peel, wasting no more of the vegetable than is necessary. They\\nmay then be cut up as desired for the recipe to be prepared.\\n\\n125. STEWED TURNIPS.--When turnips are stewed until tender and then\\nseasoned with salt and pepper and flavored with butter they form a very\\npalatable dish.\\n\\nTo prepare them in this way, select the desired number, scrub them\\nuntil clean, and then peel them. Cut them into dice about 1/2 inch in\\nsize, and put these to cook in boiling salted water, allowing the cover\\nto remain off the kettle during the cooking. Cook until they may be\\neasily pierced with a fork and drain the water from them. Season with\\nadditional salt, if necessary, and with pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful\\nof butter for each four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt\\nand serve hot.\\n\\n126. MASHED TURNIPS.--Turnips, like potatoes, are a very good vegetable\\nto mash. Prepare the desired number in the manner explained in Art. 125.\\nCook in boiling salted water with the kettle cover removed. When tender\\nenough to be mashed easily, drain the water from them, mash with a\\npotato masher, and season with additional salt if necessary and with\\npepper and butter. Allow the butter to melt and serve hot.\\n\\n127. CREAMED TURNIPS.--Turnips, both yellow and white, make an excellent\\ndish when dressed with a cream sauce. Prepare the desired number of\\nturnips by cleaning and peeling them and cutting them into dice about\\n1/2 inch in size. Cook until tender in boiling salted water and drain.\\nPrepare a medium white sauce and pour over the turnips. Serve hot.\\n\\n\\nVEGETABLE COMBINATIONS\\n\\n128. The recipes given for the various kinds of vegetables pertain in\\nmost cases to merely one vegetable, and this is the way in which this\\nfood is usually prepared. However, there are times when it is an\\nadvantage to combine two or more vegetables. For instance, it is\\nsometimes desired to give additional variety to the menu or to utilize\\nsmall quantities of vegetable that alone would not be sufficient to\\nserve the family. Then, again, two vegetables are often prepared\\ntogether in order to obtain an attractive color combination. In view of\\nthese facts, several recipes for the most usual combinations of\\nvegetables are here given, so that the housewife may not be at a loss\\nwhen she wishes to combine two or more vegetables. It must not be\\nthought that these are the only combinations that can be prepared, for\\noften vegetables can be combined to suit the housewife's taste\\nand needs.\\n\\n129. CARROTS AND PEAS.--If an attractive combination, as well as an\\nappetizing dish, is desired, carrots and peas should be prepared\\ntogether and served with butter or a vegetable or a cream sauce. This\\ncombination may be served plain, but if there are any mashed potatoes on\\nhand and an attractive dish is desired, it may be served in potato\\nrosettes, as shown in Fig. 21.\\n\\nClean and scrape the desired number of young, tender carrots, and cut\\nthem into dice about the size of the peas that are to be used. Shell an\\nequal quantity of green peas. Put the two vegetables together in boiling\\nsalted water and cook until tender. If there is any possibility that the\\ncarrots will not cook in as short a period of time as the peas, cook\\nthem for some time before adding the peas. When tender, pour off the\\nwater, add additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, and dress with\\nbutter or, if preferred, with a vegetable or a white sauce. Heat through\\nthoroughly and serve.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 21]\\n\\nIf it is desired to serve the carrots and peas in the rosettes\\nmentioned, force hot mashed potato through a pastry tube and form the\\nrequired number of rosettes on a platter, as shown. In the center of\\neach rosette put a spoonful or two of the carrots and peas.\\n\\nIn case fresh peas cannot be secured, canned peas may be substituted.\\nWhen this is done, the carrots should be cooked until tender and the\\npeas added just before the sauce is poured over the vegetables.\\n\\n130. SUCCOTASH.--A combination of fresh shelled beans and sweet corn is\\nknown as succotash. To prepare this dish, shell the beans and put them\\nto cook in boiling salted water. Cook until they are tender and the\\nwater has boiled down until it is greatly reduced in quantity. Then cut\\nan equal amount of corn from the cob and add to the beans. Cook for a\\nfew minutes longer or until the water is sufficiently reduced, so that\\nthe combination may be served without pouring any water off. Dress with\\nbutter and season with pepper and, if necessary, additional salt.\\n\\nDuring the winter, when green corn and fresh beans cannot be secured,\\nsuccotash can be made by using dried or canned corn and dried beans.\\n\\n131. CORN AND TOMATOES.--A somewhat unusual vegetable combination is\\nmade by cooking tomatoes and green corn together.\\n\\nPrepare the desired number of tomatoes in the usual way for stewing and\\ncut an equal amount of sweet corn from the cob. Put the two vegetables\\ntogether in a saucepan and cook until the tomatoes are well stewed.\\nSeason with salt, pepper, and sugar, if desired, and add a small piece\\nof butter. Serve hot.\\n\\n132. CORN, STRING BEANS, AND TOMATOES.--Those who care for the\\ncombination of corn and tomatoes will find beans a very agreeable\\naddition to this dish.\\n\\nPrepare the corn and tomatoes as explained in Art. 131, and to them add\\nyoung, tender string beans that have been previously cooked in boiling\\nsalted water. Add the desired seasoning and a small amount of butter.\\nWhen thoroughly heated, serve.\\n\\n133. PEAS AND POTATOES.--As a rule, the first green peas and the first\\nnew potatoes come into the market at about the same time. If a delicious\\ncombination is desired, these two vegetables should be cooked together\\nand then dressed in any desirable way.\\n\\nSelect small potatoes, scrape them, and put them to cook in boiling\\nsalted water. Shell an equal amount of green peas, and add them to the\\npotatoes about 20 minutes before the potatoes become tender. Cook until\\nboth vegetables are tender, and then drain the water from them. Dress\\nwith butter, vegetable sauce, cream sauce, or thin cream and serve.\\n\\n134. TURNIPS AND POTATOES.--Persons who are likely to find the flavor of\\nturnips disagreeable can usually eat them when they are combined\\nwith potatoes.\\n\\nPare an equal number of Irish potatoes and turnips and cut them into\\nthick slices. Put them to cook in boiling salted water and cook with the\\ncover off the kettle until both are tender. Drain and dress with butter\\nor add butter and mash together. Serve hot.\\n\\n135. NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER.--A combination of food that is much\\nused by the people of the New England States and has become famous\\nthroughout the United States, consists of corned beef, potatoes,\\nturnips, and cabbage. As may well be imagined, such a combination forms\\npractically all that is necessary for a home dinner.\\n\\nSelect a good piece of corned beef and put it to cook in boiling water.\\nAbout 30 minutes before the beef has finished cooking, add additional\\nwater, if necessary, and into this place an equal quantity of Irish\\npotatoes, turnips, and cabbage prepared in the required way and cut into\\nthick slices or chunks. Cook until the vegetables are tender. Then\\nremove the beef to a platter, surround with vegetables, and serve.\\n\\n\\nSERVING VEGETABLES\\n\\n136. The way in which vegetables are served depends largely on the\\nmethod of preparation. However, a point that should never be neglected,\\nso far as cooked vegetables are concerned, no matter what plan of\\nserving is followed, is to see that they are always served hot. To make\\nthis possible, the dishes in which they are served should be heated\\nbefore the vegetables are put into them and should be kept hot until put\\non the table. When a vegetable dish has a cover, the cover should be\\nkept on until the vegetable is served and should be replaced after the\\nfirst serving, so as to keep the remainder hot.\\n\\n137. Because of the possible variety in the preparation of this class of\\nfoods, numerous ways of serving them are in practice. When a vegetable\\nis baked in a large baking dish, the dish should be placed on the table\\nand the vegetable served from it either on the plate or in individual\\ndishes. If individual baking dishes are used, these should be set on\\nsmall plates and one put at each person's place. Boiled or creamed\\nvegetables may be served at the table from a vegetable dish, being put\\non the plate or in small dishes, or they may be served in individual\\ndishes in the kitchen, and a dish placed at the left of each person's\\nplace. When the large dish or the baking dish is placed on the table, it\\nshould be placed where the vegetable may be conveniently served by the\\nhost if it is to be put on the dinner plate or by the hostess in case it\\nis to be served in individual dishes at the table.\\n\\n138. In addition to being served in these ways, vegetables also lend\\nthemselves to various attractive methods of serving. For instance, a\\nvegetable prepared with a sauce is frequently served in patty shells,\\ntimbale cases, or croustades. When this is done, the case in which the\\nvegetable is served is, as a rule, placed directly on the dinner plate.\\nPotatoes that have been mashed are often forced through a pastry tube\\neither to garnish another dish or to make a dish of potatoes more\\nattractive. For instance, when mashed potatoes are to be served, a solid\\nfoundation of the potato may be arranged in the center of a dish and a\\nlittle of the mashed potato then forced through the tube to make a\\ndesign over the top. Before being served, the dish should be placed in\\nthe oven and the potato browned on top. A little thought on the part of\\nthe housewife will enable her to work out many other attractive methods\\nin the serving of this food.\\n\\n VEGETABLES (PART 2)\\n\\nEXAMINATION QUESTIONS\\n\\n(1) (_a_) How do wild and cultivated greens differ?

I take the air and stretch myself. Like\\nEve's serpent I go upright for a bit. Yet if time presses, there may be had\\nnext door a not unsavory stowage. A drinking bar is nearest to the street\\nwhere its polished brasses catch the eye. It holds a gilded mirror to such\\nred-faced nature as consorts within. Yet you pass the bar and come upon a\\nrange of tables at the rear.\\n\\nNow, if you yield to the habits of the place you order a rump of meat.\\nGravy lies about it like a moat around a castle, and if there is in you the\\nzest for encounter, you attack it above these murky waters. \\\"This castle\\nhath a pleasant seat,\\\" you cry, and charge upon it with pike advanced. But\\nif your appetite is one to peck and mince, the whiffs that breathe upon the\\nplace come unwelcome to your nostrils. In no wise are they like the sweet\\nSouth upon your senses. There is even a suspicion in you--such is your\\ndistemper--that it is too much a witch's cauldron in the kitchen, \\\"eye of\\nnewt, and toe of frog,\\\" and you spy and poke upon your food. Bus boys bear\\noff the crockery as though they were apprenticed to a juggler and were only\\nat the beginning of their art. Waiters bawl strange messages to the cook.\\nIt's a tongue unguessed by learning, yet sharp and potent. Also, there\\ncomes a riot from the kitchen, and steam issues from the door as though the\\ndevil himself were a partner and conducted here an upper branch. Like the\\nman in the old comedy, your belly may still ring dinner, but the tinkle is\\nfaint. Such being your state, you choose a daintier place to eat.\\n\\nHaving now set upon a longer journey--the day being fine and the sidewalks\\nthronged--you pass by a restaurant that is but a few doors up the street.\\nA fellow in a white coat flops pancakes in the window. But even though the\\npancake does a double somersault and there are twenty curious noses pressed\\nagainst the glass, still you keep your course uptown.\\n\\nNor are you led off because a near-by stairway beckons you to a Chinese\\nrestaurant up above. A golden dragon swings over the door. Its race has\\nfallen since its fire-breathing grandsire guarded the fruits of the\\nHesperides. Are not \\\"soys\\\" and \\\"chou meins\\\" and other such treasures of the\\nEast laid out above? And yet the dragon dozes at its post like a sleepy\\ndog. No flame leaps up its gullet. The swish of its tail is stilled. If it\\nwag at all, it's but in friendship or because a gust of wind has stirred it\\nfrom its dreams.\\n\\nI have wondered why Chinese restaurants are generally on the second story.\\nA casual inquiry attests it. I know of one, it is true, on the ground\\nlevel, yet here I suspect a special economy. The place had formerly been a\\nGerman restaurant, with Teuton scrolls, \\\"Ich Dien,\\\" and heraldries on its\\nwalls. A frugal brush changed the decoration. From the heart of a Prussian\\nblazonry, there flares on you in Chinese yellow a recommendation to try\\n\\\"Our Chicken Chop Soy.\\\" The quartering of the House of Hohenzollern wears a\\nbaldric in praise of \\\"Subgum Noodle Warmein,\\\" which it seems they cook to\\nan unusual delicacy. Even a wall painting of Rip Van Winkle bowling at\\ntenpins in the mountains is now set off with a pigtail. But the chairs were\\nDutch and remain as such. Generally, however, Chinese restaurants are on\\nthe second story. Probably there is a ritual from the ancient days of Ming\\nTi that Chinamen when they eat shall sit as near as possible to the sacred\\nmoon.\\n\\nBut hold a bit! In your haste up town to find a place to eat, you are\\nmissing some of the finer sights upon the way. In these windows that\\nyou pass, the merchants have set their choicest wares. If there is any\\ncommodity of softer gloss than common, or one shinier to the eye--so\\nthat your poverty frets you--it is displayed here. In the window of the\\nhaberdasher, shirts--mere torsos with not a leg below or head above--yet\\ndisport themselves in gay neckwear. Despite their dismemberment they are\\ntricked to the latest turn of fashion. Can vanity survive such general\\namputation? Then there is hope for immortality.\\n\\nBut by what sad chance have these blithe fellows been disjointed? If\\na gloomy mood prevails in you--as might come from a bad turn of the\\nmarket--you fancy that the evil daughter of Herodias still lives around the\\ncorner, and that she has set out her victims to the general view. If there\\ncomes a hurdy-gurdy on the street and you cock your ear to the tune of\\nit, you may still hear the dancing measure of her wicked feet. Or it is\\npossible that these are the kindred of Holofernes and that they have supped\\nguiltily in their tents with a sisterhood of Judiths.\\n\\nOr we may conceive--our thoughts running now to food--that these gamesome\\ncreatures of the haberdasher had dressed themselves for a more recent\\nbanquet. Their black-tailed coats and glossy shirts attest a rare occasion.\\nIt was in holiday mood, when they were fresh-combed and perked in their\\nbest, that they were cut off from life. It would appear that Jack Ketch the\\nheadsman got them when they were rubbed and shining for the feast. We'll\\nnot squint upon his writ. It is enough that they were apprehended for some\\nrascality. When he came thumping on his dreadful summons, here they were\\nalready set, fopped from shoes to head in the newest whim. Spoon in hand\\nand bib across their knees--lest they fleck their careful fronts--they\\nwaited for the anchovy to come. And on a sudden they were cut off from\\nlife, unfit, unseasoned for the passage. Like the elder Hamlet's brother,\\nthey were engaged upon an act that had no relish of salvation in it. You\\nmay remember the lamentable child somewhere in Dickens, who because of an\\nabrupt and distressing accident, had a sandwich in its hand but no mouth\\nto put it in. Or perhaps you recall the cook of the Nancy Bell and his\\ngrievous end. The poor fellow was stewed in his own stew-pot. It was the\\nElderly Naval Man, you recall--the two of them being the ship's sole\\nsurvivors on the deserted island, and both of them lean with hunger--it was\\nthe Elderly Naval Man (the villain of the piece) who \\\"ups with his heels,\\nand smothers his squeals in the scum of the boiling broth.\\\"\\n\\nAnd yet by looking on these torsos of the haberdasher, one is not brought\\nto thoughts of sad mortality. Their joy is so exultant. And all the things\\nthat they hold dear--canes, gloves, silk hats, and the newer garments on\\nwhich fashion makes its twaddle--are within reach of their armless sleeves.\\nHad they fingers they would be smoothing themselves before the glass. Their\\nunbodied heads, wherever they may be, are still smiling on the world,\\ndespite their divorcement. Their tongues are still ready with a jest, their\\nlips still parted for the anchovy to come.\\n\\nA few days since, as I was thinking--for so I am pleased to call my muddy\\nstirrings--what manner of essay I might write and how best to sort and lay\\nout the rummage, it happened pat to my needs that I received from a friend\\na book entitled \\\"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened.\\\" Now, before\\nit came I had got so far as to select a title. Indeed, I had written the\\ntitle on seven different sheets of paper, each time in the hope that by\\nthe run of the words I might leap upon some further thought. Seven times I\\nfailed and in the end the sheets went into the waste basket, possibly\\nto the confusion of Annie our cook, who may have mistaken them for a\\nreiterated admonishment towards the governance of her kitchen--at the\\nleast, a hint of my desires and appetite for cheese and pippins.\\n\\n\\\"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Opened\\\" is a cook book. It is due you\\nto know this at once, otherwise your thoughts--if your nature be\\nvagrant--would drift towards family skeletons. Or maybe the domestic traits\\nprevail and you would think of dress-clothes hanging in camphorated bags\\nand a row of winter boots upon a shelf.\\n\\nI am disqualified to pass upon the merits of a cook book, for the reason\\nthat I have little discrimination in food. It is not that I am totally\\nindifferent to what lies on the platter. Indeed, I have more than a tribal\\naversion to pork in general, while, on the other hand, I quicken joyfully\\nwhen noodles are interspersed with bacon. I have a tooth for sweets, too,\\nalthough I hold it unmanly and deny it as I can. I am told also--although\\nI resent it--that my eye lights up on the appearance of a tray of French\\npastry. I admit gladly, however, my love of onions, whether they come\\nhissing from the skillet, or lie in their first tender whiteness. They\\nare at their best when they are placed on bread and are eaten largely at\\nmidnight after society has done its worst.\\n\\nA fine dinner is lost within me. A quail is but an inferior chicken--a poor\\nrelation outside the exclusive hennery. Terrapin sits low in my regard,\\neven though it has wallowed in the most aristocratic marsh. Through such\\ndinners I hack and saw my way without even gaining a memory of my progress.\\nIf asked the courses, I balk after the recital of the soup. Indeed, I am so\\nforgetful of food, even when I dine at home, that I can well believe that\\nAdam when he was questioned about the apple was in real confusion. He had\\nor he had not. It was mixed with the pomegranate or the quince that Eve had\\nsliced and cooked on the day before.\\n\\nA dinner at its best is brought to a single focus. There is one dish\\nto dominate the cloth, a single bulk to which all other dishes are\\nsubordinate. If there be turkey, it should mount from a central platter.\\nIts protruding legs out-top the candles. All other foods are, as it were,\\nprivates in Caesar's army. They do no more than flank the pageant. Nor may\\nthe pantry hold too many secrets. Within reason, everything should be\\nset out at once, or at least a gossip of its coming should run before.\\nOtherwise, if the stew is savory, how shall one reserve a corner for the\\ncustard? One must partition himself justly--else, by an over-stowage at the\\nend, he list and sink.\\n\\nI am partial to picnics--the spreading of the cloth in the woods or beside\\na stream--although I am not avid for sandwiches unless hunger press me.\\nRather, let there be a skillet in the company and let a fire be started!\\nNor need a picnic consume the day. In summer it requires but the late\\nafternoon, with such borrowing of the night as is necessary for the\\njourney home. You leave the street car, clanking with your bundles like an\\nitinerant tinman. You follow a stream, which on these lower stretches, it\\nis sad to say, is already infected with the vices of the city. Like many a\\ncountryman who has come to town, it has fallen to dissipation. It shows the\\nmarks of the bottle. Further up, its course is cleaner. You cross it in the\\nmud. Was it not Christian who fell into the bog because of the burden on\\nhis back? Then you climb a villainously long hill and pop out upon an open\\nplatform above the city.\\n\\nThe height commands a prospect to the west. Below is the smoke of a\\nthousand suppers. Up from the city there comes the hum of life, now\\nsomewhat fallen with the traffic of the day--as though Nature already\\npracticed the tune for sending her creatures off to sleep. You light a\\nfire. The baskets disgorge their secrets. Ants and other leviathans think\\nevidently that a circus has come or that bears are in the town. The chops\\nand bacon achieve their appointed destiny. You throw the last bone across\\nyour shoulder. It slips and rattles to the river. The sun sets. Night like\\nan ancient dame puts on her jewels:\\n\\n  And now that I have climbed and won this height,\\n  I must tread downward through the sloping shade\\n  And travel the bewildered tracks till night.\\n  Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed\\n  And see the gold air and the silver fade\\n  And the last bird fly into the last light.\\n\\nBy these confessions you will see how unfit I am to comment on the old cook\\nbook of Sir Kenelm Digby. Yet it lies before me. It may have escaped your\\nmemory in the din of other things, that in the time when Oliver Cromwell\\nstill walked the earth, there lived in England a man by the name of Kenelm\\nDigby, who was renowned in astrology and alchemy, piracy, wit, philosophy\\nand fashion. It appears that wherever learning wagged its bulbous head, Sir\\nKenelm was of the company. It appears, also, that wherever the mahogany did\\nmost groan, wherever the possets were spiced most delicately to the nose,\\nthere too did Sir Kenelm bib and tuck himself. With profundity, as\\nthough he sucked wisdom from its lowest depth, he spouted forth on the\\ntransmutation of the baser metals or tossed you a phrase from Paracelsus.\\nOr with long instructive finger he dissertated on the celestial universe.\\nOne would have thought that he had stood by on the making of it and that\\nhis judgment had prevailed in the larger problems. Yet he did not neglect\\nhis trencher.\\n\\nAnd now as time went on, the richness of the food did somewhat dominate his\\nperson. The girth of his wisdom grew no less, but his body fattened. In\\na word, the good gentleman's palate came to vie with his intellect. Less\\noften was he engaged upon some dark saying of Isidore of Seville. Rather,\\neven if his favorite topic astrology were uppermost about the table, his\\neye travelled to the pantry on every change of dishes. His fingers, too,\\ncame to curl most delicately on his fork. He used it like an epicure,\\npoking his viands apart for sharpest scrutiny. His nod upon a compote was\\nmuch esteemed.\\n\\nNow mark his further decline! On an occasion--surely the old rascal's head\\nis turned!--he would be found in private talk with his hostess, the Lady of\\nMiddlesex, or with the Countess of Monmouth, not as you might expect, on\\nthe properties of fire or on the mortal diseases of man, but--on subjects\\nquite removed. Society, we may be sure, began to whisper of these snug\\nparleys in the arbor after dinner, these shadowed mumblings on the balcony\\nwhen the moon was up--and Lady Digby stiffened into watchfulness. It was\\nwhen they took leave that she saw the Countess slip a note into her lord's\\nfingers. Her jealousy broke out. \\\"Viper!\\\" She spat the words and seized her\\nhusband's wrist. Of course the note was read. It proved, however, that Sir\\nKenelm was innocent of all mischief. To the disappointment of the gossips,\\nwho were tuned to a spicier anticipation, the note was no more than a\\nrecipe of the manner that the Countess was used to mix her syllabub, with\\ninstruction that it was the \\\"rosemary a little bruised and the limon-peal\\nthat did quicken the taste.\\\" Advice, also, followed in the postscript on\\nthe making of tea, with counsel that \\\"the boiling water should remain upon\\nit just so long as one might say a _miserere_.\\\" A mutual innocence being\\nnow established, the Lady Digby did by way of apology peck the Countess on\\nthe cheek.\\n\\nSir Kenelm died in 1665, full of years. In that day his fame rested chiefly\\non his books in physic and chirurgery. His most enduring work was still to\\nbe published--\\\"The Closet Opened.\\\"\\n\\nIt was two years after his death that his son came upon a bundle of his\\nfather's papers that had hitherto been overlooked. I fancy that he went\\nspying in the attic on a rainy day. In the darkest corner, behind the\\nrocking horse--if such devices were known in those distant days--he came\\nupon a trunk of his father's papers. \\\"Od's fish,\\\" said Sir Kenelm's son,\\n\\\"here's a box of manuscripts. It is like that they pertain to alchemy or\\nchirurgery.\\\" He pulled out a bundle and held it to the light--such light as\\ncame through the cobwebs of the ancient windows. \\\"Here be strange matters,\\\"\\nhe exclaimed. Then he read aloud: \\\"My Lord of Bristol's Scotch collops are\\nthus made: Take a leg of fine sweet mutton, that to make it tender, is\\nkept as long as possible may be without stinking. In winter seven or eight\\ndays\\\"--\\\"Ho! Ho!\\\" cried Sir Kenelm's son. \\\"This is not alchemy!\\\" He drew out\\nanother parchment and read again: \\\"My Lord of Carlile's sack posset, how\\nit's made: Take a pottle of cream and boil in it a little whole cinnamon\\nand three or four flakes of mace. Boil it until it simpreth and bubbleth.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time, as you may well imagine, Sir Kenelm's son was wrought to an\\nexcitement. It is likely that he inherited his father's palate and that the\\njuices of his appetite were stirred. Seizing an armful of the papers, he\\nleaped down the attic steps, three at a time. His lady mother thrust a\\ncurled and papered head from her door and asked whether the chimney were\\nafire, but he did not heed her. The cook was waddling in her pattens. He\\ncried to her to throw wood upon the fire.\\n\\nThat night the Digby household was served a delicacy, red herrings broiled\\nin the fashion of my Lord d'Aubigny, \\\"short and crisp and laid upon a\\nsallet.\\\" Also, there was a wheaten flommery as it was made in the West\\nCountry--for the cook chose quite at random--and a slip-coat cheese as\\nMaster Phillips proportioned it. Also, against the colic, which was\\nravishing the country, the cook prepared a metheglin as Lady Stuart mixed\\nit--\\\"nettles, fennel and grumel seeds, of each two ounces being small-cut\\nand mixed with honey and boiled together.\\\" It is on record that the Lady\\nDigby smiled for the first time since her lord had died, and when the\\ngrinning cook bore in the platter, she beat upon the table with her spoon.\\n\\nThe following morning, Sir Kenelm's son posted to London bearing the\\nrecipes, with a pistol in the pocket of his great coat against the crossing\\nof Hounslow Heath. He went to a printer at the Star in Little Britain whose\\nname was H. Brome.\\n\\nShortly the book appeared. It was the son who wrote the preface: \\\"There\\nneeds no Rhetoricating Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well\\nknown, having been a Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite\\nCuriosity in his Researches. Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie\\nKnight, Fellow of the Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother,\\n(Et omen in Nomine) His name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work.\\\" The\\nsale of the book is not recorded. It is supposed that the Lady Middlesex,\\nso many of whose recipes had been used, directed that her chair be carried\\nto the shop where the book was for sale and that she bought largely of it.\\nThe Countess of Dorset bought a copy and spelled it out word for word to\\nher cook. As for the Lady Monmouth, she bought not a single copy, which\\nneglect on coming to the Digbys aroused a coolness.\\n\\nTo this day it is likely that a last auspicated volume still sits on its\\nshelf with the spice jars in some English country kitchen and that a worn\\nand toothless cook still thumbs its leaves. If the guests about the table\\nbe of an antique mind, still will they pledge one another with its honeyed\\ndrinks, still will they pipe and whistle of its virtues, still will they--\\n\\n\\\"EAT\\\"--A flaring sign hangs above the sidewalk. By this time, in our\\nnoonday search for food, we have come into the thick of the restaurants. In\\nthe jungle of the city, here is the feeding place. Here come the growling\\nbipeds for such bones and messes as are thrown them.\\n\\nThe waiter thrusts a card beneath my nose. \\\"Nice leg of lamb, sir?\\\" I waved\\nhim off. \\\"Hold a bit!\\\" I cried. \\\"You'll fetch me a capon in white broth as\\nmy Lady Monmouth broileth hers. Put plentiful sack in it and boil it until\\nit simpreth!\\\" The waiter scratched his head. \\\"The chicken pie is good,\\\" he\\nsaid. \\\"It's our Wednesday dish.\\\" \\\"Varlet!\\\" I cried--then softened. \\\"Let it\\nbe the chicken pie! But if the cook knoweth the manner that Lord Carlile\\ndoes mix and pepper it, let that manner be followed to the smallest\\nfraction of a pinch!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Buying Old Books\\n\\n\\nBy some slim chance, reader, you may be the kind of person who, on a visit\\nto a strange city, makes for a bookshop. Of course your slight temporal\\nbusiness may detain you in the earlier hours of the day. You sit with\\ncommittees and stroke your profound chin, or you spend your talent in the\\nmarket, or run to and fro and wag your tongue in persuasion. Or, if you be\\non a holiday, you strain yourself on the sights of the city, against being\\ncaught in an omission. The bolder features of a cathedral must be grasped\\nto satisfy a quizzing neighbor lest he shame you later on your hearth, a\\nbuilding must be stuffed inside your memory, or your pilgrim feet must wear\\nthe pavement of an ancient shrine. However, these duties being done and the\\nafternoon having not yet declined, do you not seek a bookshop to regale\\nyourself?\\n\\nDoubtless, we have met. As you have scrunched against the shelf not to\\nblock the passage, but with your head thrown back to see the titles up\\nabove, you have noticed at the corner of your eye--unless it was one of\\nyour blinder moments when you were fixed wholly on the shelf--a man in\\na slightly faded overcoat of mixed black and white, a man just past the\\nnimbleness of youth, whose head is plucked of its full commodity of hair.\\nIt was myself. I admit the portrait, though modesty has curbed me short of\\njustice.\\n\\nDoubtless, we have met. It was your umbrella--which you held villainously\\nbeneath your arm--that took me in the ribs when you lighted on a set of\\nFuller's Worthies. You recall my sour looks, but it was because I had\\nmyself lingered on the volumes but cooled at the price. How you smoothed\\nand fingered them! With what triumph you bore them off! I bid you--for I\\nsee you in a slippered state, eased and unbuttoned after dinner--I bid you\\nturn the pages with a slow thumb, not to miss the slightest tang of their\\nhumor. You will of course go first, because of its broad fame, to the page\\non Shakespeare and Ben Jonson and their wet-combats at the Mermaid. But\\nbefore the night is too far gone and while yet you can hold yourself from\\nnodding, you will please read about Captain John Smith of Virginia and his\\n\\\"strange performances, the scene whereof is laid at such a distance, they\\nare cheaper credited than confuted.\\\"\\n\\nIn no proper sense am I a buyer of old books. I admit a bookish quirk\\nmaybe, a love of the shelf, a weakness for morocco, especially if it is\\nstained with age. I will, indeed, shirk a wedding for a bookshop. I'll\\ngo in \\\"just to look about a bit, to see what the fellow has,\\\" and on an\\noccasion I pick up a volume. But I am innocent of first editions. It is\\na stiff courtesy, as becomes a democrat, that I bestow on this form\\nof primogeniture. Of course, I have nosed my way with pleasure along\\naristocratic shelves and flipped out volumes here and there to ask their\\nprice, but for the greater part, it is the plainer shops that engage me. If\\na rack of books is offered cheap before the door, with a fixed price upon a\\ncard, I come at a trot. And if a brown dust lies on them, I bow and sniff\\nupon the rack, as though the past like an ancient fop in peruke and buckle\\nwere giving me the courtesy of its snuff box. If I take the dust in my\\nnostrils and chance to sneeze, it is the fit and intended observance toward\\nthe manners of a former century.\\n\\nI have in mind such a bookshop in Bath, England. It presents to the street\\nno more than a decent front, but opens up behind like a swollen bottle.\\nThere are twenty rooms at least, piled together with such confusion of\\nblack passages and winding steps, that one might think that the owner\\nhimself must hold a thread when he visits the remoter rooms. Indeed, such\\nare the obscurities and dim turnings of the place, that, were the legend of\\nthe Minotaur but English, you might fancy that the creature still lived in\\nthis labyrinth, to nip you between his toothless gums--for the beast grows\\nold--at some darker corner. There is a story of the place, that once a raw\\nclerk having been sent to rummage in the basement, his candle tipped off\\nthe shelf. He was left in so complete darkness that his fears overcame his\\njudgment and for two hours he roamed and babbled among the barrels. Nor was\\nhis absence discovered until the end of the day when, as was the custom,\\nthe clerks counted noses at the door. When they found him, he bolted up the\\nsteps, nor did he cease his whimper until he had reached the comforting\\ntwilight of the outer world. He served thereafter in the shop a full two\\nyears and had a beard coming--so the story runs--before he would again\\nventure beyond the third turning of the passage; to the stunting of his\\nscholarship, for the deeper books lay in the farther windings.\\n\\nOr it may appear credible that in ages past a jealous builder contrived the\\nplace. Having no learning himself and being at odds with those of better\\nopportunity, he twisted the pattern of the house. Such was his evil temper,\\nthat he set the steps at a dangerous hazard in the dark, in order that\\nscholars--whose eyes are bleared at best--might risk their legs to the end\\nof time. Those of strict orthodoxy have even suspected the builder to have\\nbeen an atheist, for they have observed what double joints and steps and\\nturnings confuse the passage to the devouter books--the Early Fathers in\\nparticular being up a winding stair where even the soberest reader might\\nbreak his neck. Be these things as they may, leather bindings in sets of\\n\\\"grenadier uniformity\\\" ornament the upper and lighter rooms. Biography\\nstraggles down a hallway, with a candle needed at the farther end. A room\\nof dingy plays--Wycherley, Congreve and their crew--looks out through an\\narea grating. It was through even so foul an eye, that when alive, they\\nlooked upon the world. As for theology, except for the before-mentioned\\nFathers, it sits in general and dusty convention on the landing to the\\nbasement, its snuffy sermons, by a sad misplacement--or is there an\\nironical intention?--pointing the way to the eternal abyss below.\\n\\nIt was in this shop that I inquired whether there was published a book on\\npiracy in Cornwall. Now, I had lately come from Tintagel on the Cornish\\ncoast, and as I had climbed upon the rocks and looked down upon the sea, I\\nhad wondered to myself whether, if the knowledge were put out before me, I\\ncould compose a story of Spanish treasure and pirates. For I am a prey to\\nsuch giddy ambition. A foul street--if the buildings slant and topple--will\\nset me thinking delightfully of murders. A wharf-end with water lapping\\nunderneath and bits of rope about will set me itching for a deep-sea plot.\\nOr if I go on broader range and see in my fancy a broken castle on a hill,\\nI'll clear its moat and sound trumpets on its walls. If there is pepper\\nin my mood, I'll storm its dungeon. Or in a softer moment I'll trim its\\nunsubstantial towers with pageantry and rest upon my elbow until I fall\\nasleep. So being cast upon the rugged Cornish coast whose cliffs are so\\nswept with winter winds that the villages sit for comfort in the hollows,\\nit was to be expected that my thoughts would run toward pirates.\\n\\nThere is one rock especially which I had climbed in the rain and fog of\\nearly morning. A reckless path goes across its face with a sharp pitch to\\nthe ocean. It was so slippery and the wind so tugged and pulled to throw me\\noff, that although I endangered my dignity, I played the quadruped on the\\nnarrower parts. But once on top in the open blast of the storm and safe\\nupon the level, I thumped with desire for a plot. In each inlet from the\\nocean I saw a pirate lugger--such is the pleasing word--with a keg of rum\\nset up. Each cranny led to a cavern with doubloons piled inside. The\\nvery tempest in my ears was compounded out of ships at sea and wreck and\\npillage. I needed but a plot, a thread of action to string my villains on.\\nIf this were once contrived, I would spice my text with sailors' oaths and\\nsuch boasting talk as might lie in my invention. Could I but come upon a\\nplot, I might yet proclaim myself an author.\\n\\nWith this guilty secret in me I blushed as I asked the question. It seemed\\nsure that the shopkeeper must guess my purpose. I felt myself suspected as\\nthough I were a rascal buying pistols to commit a murder. Indeed, I seem\\nto remember having read that even hardened criminals have become confused\\nbefore a shopkeeper and betrayed themselves. Of course, Dick Turpin and\\nJerry Abershaw could call for pistols in the same easy tone they ordered\\nale, but it would take a practiced villainy. But I in my innocence wanted\\nnothing but the meager outline of a pirate's life, which I might fatten to\\nmy uses.\\n\\nBut on a less occasion, when there is no plot thumping in me, I still feel\\na kind of embarrassment when I ask for a book out of the general demand. I\\nfeel so like an odd stick. This embarrassment applies not to the request\\nfor other commodities. I will order a collar that is quite outside the\\nfashion, in a high-pitched voice so that the whole shop can hear. I could\\nbargain for a purple waistcoat--did my taste run so--and though the\\nsidewalk listened, it would not draw a blush. I have traded even for\\nwomen's garments--though this did strain me--without an outward twitch.\\nFinally, to top my valor, I have bought sheet music of the lighter kind and\\nhave pronounced the softest titles so that all could hear. But if I desire\\nthe poems of Lovelace or the plays of Marlowe, I sidle close up to the\\nshopkeeper to get his very ear. If the book is visible, I point my thumb at\\nit without a word.\\n\\nIt was but the other day--in order to fill a gap in a paper I was\\nwriting--I desired to know the name of an author who is obscure although\\nhis work has been translated into nearly all languages. I wanted to know a\\nlittle about the life of the man who wrote _Mary Had a Little Lamb_, which,\\nI am told, is known by children over pretty much all the western world. It\\nneeded only a trip to the Public Library. Any attendant would direct me to\\nthe proper shelf. Yet once in the building, my courage oozed. My question,\\nthough serious, seemed too ridiculous to be asked. I would sizzle as I\\nmet the attendant's eye. Of a consequence, I fumbled on my own devices,\\npossibly to the increase of my general knowledge, but without gaining what\\nI sought.\\n\\nThey had no book in the Bath shop on piracy in Cornwall. I was offered\\ninstead a work in two volumes on the notorious highwaymen of history, and\\nfor a moment my plot swerved in that direction. But I put it by. To pay the\\nfellow for his pains--for he had dug in barrels to his shoulders and had a\\nsmudge across his nose--I bought a copy of Thomson's \\\"Castle of Indolence,\\\"\\nand in my more energetic moods I read it. And so I came away.\\n\\nOn leaving the shop, lest I should be nipped in a neglect, I visited the\\nRoman baths. Then I took the waters in the Assembly Room. It was Sam\\nWeller, you may recall, who remarked, when he was entertained by the select\\nfootmen, that the waters tasted like warm flat-irons. Finally, I viewed\\nthe Crescent around which the shirted Winkle ran with the valorous Dowler\\nbreathing on his neck. With such distractions, as you may well imagine,\\nCornish pirates became as naught. Such mental vibration as I had was now\\ngone toward a tale of fashion in the days when Queen Anne was still alive.\\nOf a consequence, I again sought the bookshop and stifling my timidity, I\\ndemanded such volumes as might set me most agreeably to my task.\\n\\nI have in mind also a bookshop of small pretension in a town in Wales. For\\npurely secular delight, maybe, it was too largely composed of Methodist\\nsermons. Hell fire burned upon its shelves with a warmth to singe so poor a\\nworm as I. Yet its signboard popped its welcome when I had walked ten miles\\nof sunny road. Possibly it was the chair rather than the divinity that\\nkeeps the place in memory. The owner was absent on an errand, and his\\ndaughter, who had been clumping about the kitchen on my arrival, was\\nuninstructed in the price marks. So I read and fanned myself until his\\nreturn.\\n\\nPerhaps my sluggishness toward first editions--to which I have hinted\\nabove--comes in part from the acquaintance with a man who in a linguistic\\noutburst as I met him, pronounced himself to be a numismatist and\\nphilatelist. One only of these names would have satisfied a man of less\\nconceit. It is as though the pteranodon should claim also to be the\\nspoon-bill dinosaur. It is against modesty that one man should summon all\\nthe letters. No, the numismatist's head is not crammed with the mysteries\\nof life and death, nor is a philatelist one who is possessed with the\\ndimmer secrets of eternity. Rather, this man who was so swelled with\\ntitles, eked a living by selling coins and stamps, and he was on his way\\nto Europe to replenish his wares. Inside his waistcoat, just above his\\nliver--if he owned so human an appendage--he carried a magnifying glass.\\nWith this, when the business fit was on him, he counted the lines and dots\\nupon a stamp, the perforations on its edge. He catalogued its volutes, its\\nstipples, the frisks and curlings of its pattern. He had numbered the very\\nhairs on the head of George Washington, for in such minutiae did the value\\nof the stamp reside. Did a single hair spring up above the count, it would\\ninvalidate the issue. Such values, got by circumstance or accident--resting\\non a flaw--founded on a speck--cause no ferment of my desires.\\n\\nFor the buying of books, it is the cheaper shops where I most often prowl.\\nThere is in London a district around Charing Cross Road where almost every\\nshop has books for sale. There is a continuous rack along the sidewalk,\\neach title beckoning for your attention. You recall the class of\\nstreet-readers of whom Charles Lamb wrote--\\\"poor gentry, who, not having\\nwherewithal to buy or hire a book, filch a little learning at the open\\nstalls.\\\" It was on some such street that these folk practiced their\\ninnocent larceny. If one shopkeeper frowned at the diligence with which\\nthey read \\\"Clarissa,\\\" they would continue her distressing adventures across\\nthe way. By a lingering progress up the street, \\\"Sir Charles Grandison\\\"\\nmight be nibbled down--by such as had the stomach--without the outlay of\\na single penny. As for Gibbon and the bulbous historians, though a whole\\nperusal would outlast the summer and stretch to the colder months, yet with\\npatience they could be got through. However, before the end was come even a\\nhasty reader whose eye was nimble on the page would be blowing on his nails\\nand pulling his tails between him and the November wind.\\n\\nBut the habit of reading at the open stalls was not only with the poor. You\\nwill remember that Mr. Brownlow was addicted. Really, had not the Artful\\nDodger stolen his pocket handkerchief as he was thus engaged upon his book,\\nthe whole history of Oliver Twist must have been quite different. And Pepys\\nhimself, Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., was guilty. \\\"To Paul's Church Yard,\\\" he\\nwrites, \\\"and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy\\nnot, but borrow to read.\\\" Such parsimony is the curse of authors. To thumb\\na volume cheaply around a neighborhood is what keeps them in their garrets.\\nIt is a less offence to steal peanuts from a stand. Also, it is recorded in\\nthe life of Beau Nash that the persons of fashion of his time, to pass a\\ntedious morning \\\"did divert themselves with reading in the booksellers'\\nshops.\\\" We may conceive Mr. Fanciful Fopling in the sleepy blink of those\\nearly hours before the pleasures of the day have made a start, inquiring\\nbetween his yawns what latest novels have come down from London, or whether\\na new part of \\\"Pamela\\\" is offered yet. If the post be in, he will prop\\nhimself against the shelf and--unless he glaze and nod--he will read\\ncheaply for an hour. Or my Lady Betty, having taken the waters in the\\npump-room and lent her ear to such gossip as is abroad so early, is now\\nhanded to her chair and goes round by Gregory's to read a bit. She is\\nflounced to the width of the passage. Indeed, until the fashion shall\\nabate, those more solid authors that are set up in the rear of the shop,\\nmust remain during her visits in general neglect. Though she hold herself\\nagainst the shelf and tilt her hoops, it would not be possible to pass. She\\nis absorbed in a book of the softer sort, and she flips its pages against\\nher lap-dog's nose.\\n\\nBut now behold the student coming up the street! He is clad in shining\\nblack. He is thin of shank as becomes a scholar. He sags with knowledge. He\\nhungers after wisdom. He comes opposite the bookshop. It is but coquetry\\nthat his eyes seek the window of the tobacconist. His heart, you may be\\nsure, looks through the buttons at his back. At last he turns. He pauses on\\nthe curb. Now desire has clutched him. He jiggles his trousered shillings.\\nHe treads the gutter. He squints upon the rack. He lights upon a treasure.\\nHe plucks it forth. He is unresolved whether to buy it or to spend the\\nextra shilling on his dinner. Now all you cooks together, to save your\\nbusiness, rattle your pans to rouse him! If within these ancient buildings\\nthere are onions ready peeled--quick!--throw them in the skillet that the\\nwhiff may come beneath his nose! Chance trembles and casts its vote--eenie\\nmeenie--down goes the shilling--he has bought the book. Tonight he will\\nspread it beneath his candle. Feet may beat a snare of pleasure on the\\npavement, glad cries may pipe across the darkness, a fiddle may scratch its\\ninvitation--all the rumbling notes of midnight traffic will tap in vain\\ntheir summons upon his window.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny Stick Will Do To Beat A Dog\\n\\n\\nReader, possibly on one of your country walks you have come upon a man with\\nhis back against a hedge, tormented by a fiend in the likeness of a dog.\\nYou yourself, of course, are not a coward. You possess that cornerstone of\\nvirtue, a love for animals. If at your heels a dog sniffs and growls, you\\nhumor his mistake, you flick him off and proceed with unbroken serenity. It\\nis scarcely an interlude to your speculation on the market. Or if you work\\nupon a sonnet and are in the vein, your thoughts, despite the beast, run\\nunbroken to a rhyme. But pity this other whose heart is less stoutly\\nwrapped! He has gone forth on a holiday to take the country air, to thrust\\nhimself into the freer wind, to poke with his stick for such signs of\\nSpring as may be hiding in the winter's leaves. Having been grinding in an\\noffice he flings himself on the great round world. He has come out to smell\\nthe earth. Or maybe he seeks a hilltop for a view of the fields that lie\\nbelow patched in many colors, as though nature had been sewing at her\\ngarments and had mended the cloth from her bag of scraps.\\n\\nOn such a journey this fellow is travelling when, at a turn of the road, he\\nhears the sound of barking. As yet there is no dog in sight. He pauses. He\\nlistens. How shall one know whether the sound comes up a wrathful gullet or\\nwhether the dog bays at him impersonally, as at the distant moon? Or maybe\\nhe vents himself upon a stubborn cow. Surely it is not an idle tune he\\npractices. He holds a victim in his mind. There is sour venom on his\\nchurlish tooth. Is it best to go roundabout, or forward with such a nice\\ncompound of innocence, boldness and modesty as shall satisfy the beast? If\\none engross oneself on something that lies to the lee of danger, it allays\\nsuspicion. Or if one absorb oneself upon the flora--a primrose on the\\nriver's brim--it shows him clear and stainless. The stupidest dog should\\nsee that so close a student can have no evil in him. Perhaps it would be\\nbetter to throw away one's stick lest it make a show of violence. Or it may\\nbe concealed along the outer leg. Ministers of Grace defend us, what an\\nexcitement in the barnyard! Has virtue no reward? Shall innocence perish\\noff the earth? Not one dog, but many, come running out. There has gone\\na rumor about the barn that there is a stranger to be eaten, and it's\\nlikely--if they keep their clamor--there will be a bone for each. Note how\\nthe valor oozes from the man of peace! Observe his sidling gait, his skirts\\npulled close, his hollowed back, his head bent across his shoulder, his\\nstartled eye! Watch him mince his steps, lest a lingering heel be nipped!\\nListen to him try the foremost dog with names, to gull him to a belief that\\nthey have met before in happier circumstances! He appeals mutely to the\\nfarmhouse that a recall be sounded. The windows are tightly curtained. The\\nheavens are comfortless.\\n\\nYou remember the fellow in the play who would have loved war had they not\\ndigged villainous saltpetre from the harmless earth. The countryside, too,\\nin my opinion, would be more peaceful of a summer afternoon were it not\\noverrun with dogs. Let me be plain! I myself like dogs--sleepy dogs\\nblinking in the firelight, friendly dogs with wagging tails, young dogs in\\ntheir first puppyhood with their teeth scarce sprouted, whose jaws have not\\nyet burgeoned into danger, and old dogs, too, who sun themselves and give\\nforth hollow, toothless, reassuring sounds. When a dog assumes the cozy\\nhabits of the cat without laying off his nobler nature, he is my friend. A\\ndog of vegetarian aspect pleases me. Let him bear a mild eye as though he\\nwere nourished on the softer foods! I would wish every dog to have a full\\ncomplement of tail. It's the sure barometer of his warm regard. There's no\\nart to find his mind's construction in the face. And I would have him with\\nnot too much curiosity. It's a quality that brings him too often to the\\ngate. It makes him prone to sniff when one sits upon a visit. Nor do I like\\ndogs addicted to sudden excitement. Lethargy becomes them better. Let them\\nbe without the Gallic graces! In general, I like a dog to whom I have been\\nproperly introduced, with an exchange of credentials. While the dog is by,\\nlet his master take my hand and address me in softest tones, to cement the\\nunderstanding! At bench-shows I love the beasts, although I keep to the\\nmiddle of the aisle. The streets are all the safer when so many of the\\ncreatures are kept within.\\n\\nFrankly, I would enjoy the country more, if I knew that all the dogs were\\naway on visits. Of course, the highroad is quite safe. Its frequent traffic\\nis its insurance. Then, too, the barns are at such a distance, it is only a\\nmonstrous anger can bring the dog. But if you are in need of direction you\\nselect a friendly white house with green shutters. You swing open the gate\\nand crunch across the pebbles to the door. To the nearer eye there is a\\nlook of \\\"dog\\\" about the place. Or maybe you are hot and thirsty, and there\\nis a well at the side of the house. Is it better to gird yourself to danger\\nor to put off your thirst until the crossroads where pop is sold?\\n\\nOr a lane leads down to the river. Even at this distance you hear the\\nshallow brawl of water on the stones. A path goes off across a hill, with\\ntrees beckoning at the top. There is a wind above and a wider sweep of\\nclouds. Surely, from the crest of the hill the whole county will lie before\\nyou. Such tunes as come up from the world below--a school-bell, a rooster\\ncrowing, children laughing on the road, a threshing machine on the lower\\nmeadows--such tunes are pitched to a marvellous softness. Shall we follow\\nthe hot pavement, or shall we dare those lonely stretches?\\n\\nThere is a kind of person who is steeped too much in valor. He will cross a\\nfield although there is a dog inside the fence. Goodness knows that I would\\nrather keep to the highroad with such humility as shall not rouse the\\ncreature. Or he will shout and whistle tunes that stir the dogs for miles.\\nHe slashes his stick against the weeds as though in challenge. One might\\nthink that he went about on unfeeling stalks instead of legs as children\\nwalk on stilts, or that a former accident had clipped him off above the\\nknees and that he was now jointed out of wood to a point beyond the biting\\nlimit. Or perhaps the clothes he wears beneath--the inner mesh and very\\nbalbriggan of his attire--is of so hard a texture that it turns a tooth. Be\\nthese defenses as they may, note with what bravado he mounts the wall! One\\nleg dangles as though it were baited and were angling for a bite.\\n\\nThere is a French village near Quebec whose population is chiefly dogs.\\nIt lies along the river in a single street, not many miles from the point\\nwhere Wolfe climbed to the Plains of Abraham. There are a hundred houses\\nflat against the roadway and on the steps of each there sits a dog. As I\\nwent through on foot, each of these dogs picked me up, examined me nasally\\nand passed me on, not generously as though I had stood the test, but rather\\nin deep suspicion that I was a queer fellow, not to be penetrated at first,\\nbut one who would surely be found out and gobbled before coming to the\\nend of the street. As long as I would eventually furnish forth the common\\nbanquet, it mattered not which dog took the first nip. Inasmuch as I would\\nat last be garnished for the general tooth, it would be better to wait\\nuntil all were gathered around the platter. \\\"Good neighbor dog,\\\" each\\nseemed to say, \\\"you too sniff upon the rogue! If he be honest, my old nose\\nis much at fault.\\\" Meantime I padded lightly through the village, at first\\ncalling on the dogs by English names, but later using such wisps as I had\\nof French. \\\"Aucassin, mon pauvre chien. Voici, Tintagiles, alors donc mon\\ncherie. Je suis votre ami,\\\" but with little effect.\\n\\nBut the dogs that one meets in the Canadian woods are of the fiercest\\nbreed. They border on the wolf. They are called huskies and they are so\\nstrong and so fleet of foot that they pull sleds for hours across the\\nfrozen lakes at almost the speed of a running horse. It must be confessed\\nthat they are handsome and if it happens to be your potato peelings and\\ndiscarded fish that they eat, they warm into friendliness. Indeed, on these\\noccasions, one can make quite a show of bravery by stroking and dealing\\nlightly with them. But once upon a time in an ignorant moment two other\\ncampers and myself followed a lonely railroad track and struck off on a\\npath through the pines in search of a certain trapper on a fur farm. The\\npath went on a broken zigzag avoiding fallen trees and soft hollows,\\nconducting itself on the whole with more patience than firmness. We walked\\na quarter of a mile, but still we saw no cabin. The line of the railroad\\nhad long since disappeared. An eagle wheeled above us and quarrelled at our\\nintrusion. Presently to test our course and learn whether we were coming\\nnear the cabin, we gave a shout. Immediately out of the deeper woods there\\ncame a clamor that froze us. Such sounds, it seemed, could issue only from\\nbloody and dripping jaws. In a panic, as by a common impulse we turned and\\nran. Yet we did not run frankly as when the circus lion is loose, but in a\\nshamefaced manner--an attempt at a retreat in good order--something between\\na walk and a run. At the end of a hundred yards we stopped. No dogs had\\nfallen on us. Danger had not burst its kennel. We hallooed again, to rouse\\nthe trapper. At last, after a minute of suspense, came his answering voice,\\nthe sweetest sound to be imagined. Whereupon I came down from my high stump\\nwhich I had climbed for a longer view.\\n\\nI am convinced that I am not alone in my--shall I say diffidence?--toward\\ndogs. Indeed, there is evidence from the oldest times that mankind, in its\\nmore honest moments, has confessed to a fear of dogs. In recognition of\\nthis general fear, the unmuzzled Cerberus was put at the gate of Hades.\\nIt was rightly felt that when the unhappy pilgrims got within, his fifty\\nsnapping heads were better than a bolt upon the door. It was better for\\nthem to endure the ills they had, than be nipped in the upper passage. He,\\nalso, who first spoke the ancient proverb, _Let sleeping dogs lie_, did no\\nmore than voice the caution of the street. And he, also, who invented the\\nsaying that the world is going to the bow-wows, lodged his deplorable\\npessimism in fitting words.\\n\\nIt was Daniel who sat with the lions. But there are degrees of bravery. On\\nLong Street, within sight of my window--just where the street gets into its\\nmost tangled traffic--there has hung for many years the painted signboard\\nof a veterinary surgeon. Its artist was in the first flourish of youth. Old\\nage had not yet chilled him when he mixed his gaudy colors. The surgeon's\\nname is set up in modest letters, but the horse below flames with color.\\nWhat a flaring nostril! What an eager eye! How arched the neck! Here is a\\nwrath and speed unknown to the quadrupeds of this present Long Street. Such\\nmild-eyed, accumbent, sharp-ribbed horses as now infest the curb--mere\\nwhittlings from a larger age--hang their heads at their degeneracy. Indeed,\\nthese horses seem to their owners not to be worth the price of a nostrum.\\nIf disease settles in them, let them lean against a post until the fit is\\npast! And of a consequence, the doctor's work has fallen off. It has\\nbecome a rare occasion when it is permitted him to stroke his chin in\\ncontemplation of some inner palsy. Therefore to give his wisdom scope,\\nthe doctor some time since announced the cellar of the building to be a\\nhospital for dogs. Must I press the analogy? I have seen the doctor with\\nbowl and spoon in hand take leave of the cheerful world. He opens the\\ncellar door. A curdling yelp comes up the stairs. In the abyss below there\\nare twenty dogs at least, all of them sick, all dangerous. Not since Orion\\nled his hunting pack across the heavens has there been so fierce a sound.\\nThe door closes. There is a final yelp, such as greets a bone. Doubtless,\\nby this time, they are munching on the doctor. Good sir, had you lived in\\npre-apostolic days, your name would have been lined with Daniel's in the\\nhymn. I might have spent my earliest treble in your praise.\\n\\nBut there are other kinds of dogs. Gentlest of readers, have you ever\\npassed a few days at Tunbridge Wells? It lies on one of the roads that run\\nfrom London to the Channel and for several hundred years persons have gone\\nthere to take the waters against the more fashionable ailments. Its chief\\nfame was in the days when rich folk, to ward off for the season a touch of\\nancestral gout, travelled down from London in their coaches. We may fancy\\nLord Thingumdo crossing his sleek legs inside or putting his head to the\\nwindow on the change of horses. He has outriders and a horn to sound his\\ncoming. His Lordship has a liver that must be mended, but also he has\\na weakness for the gaming table. Or Lady Euphemia, wrapped in silks,\\nlanguishes mornings in her lodgings with a latest novel, but goes forth at\\nnoon upon the Pantilles to shop in the stalls. A box of patches must be\\nbought. A lace flounce has caught her eye. Bless her dear eyes, as she\\nbends upon her purchase she is fair to look upon. The Grand Rout is set for\\ntonight. Who knows but that the Duke will put the tender question and will\\nask her to name the happy day?\\n\\nBut these golden days are past. Tunbridge Wells has sunk from fashion. The\\ngaming tables are gone. A band still plays mornings in the Pantilles--or\\ndid so before the war--but cheaper gauds are offered in the shops. Emerald\\nbrooches are fallen to paste. In all the season there is scarcely a single\\ndemand for a diamond garter. If there were now a Rout, the only dancers\\nwould be stiff shadows from the past. The healing waters still trickle from\\nthe ground and an old woman serves you for a penny, but the miracle has\\ngone. The old world is cured and dead.\\n\\nTunbridge Wells is visited now chiefly by old ladies whose husbands--to\\njudge by the black lace caps--have left Lombard Street for heaven. At the\\nhotel where I stopped, which was at the top of the Commons outside the\\nthicker town, I was the only man in the breakfast room. Two widows, each\\nwith a tiny dog on a chair beside her, sat at the next table. This was\\ntheir conversation:\\n\\n\\\"Did you hear her last night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was it Flossie that I heard?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. The poor dear was awake all night. She got her feet wet yesterday\\nwhen I let her run upon the grass.\\\"\\n\\nBut after breakfast--if the day is sunny and the wind sits in a favoring\\nquarter--one by one the widows go forth in their chairs. These are wicker\\ncontrivances that hang between three wheels. Burros pull them, and men walk\\nalongside to hold their bridles. Down comes the widow. Down comes a maid\\nwith her wraps. Down comes a maid with Flossie. The wraps are adjusted. The\\nwidow is handed in. Her feet are wound around with comforters against a\\ndraft. Her salts rest in her lap. Her ample bag of knitting is safe aboard.\\nFlossie is placed beside her. Proot! The donkey starts.\\n\\nAll morning the widow sits in the Pantilles and listens to the band and\\nknits. Flossie sits on the flagging at her feet with an intent eye upon the\\nball of worsted. Twice in a morning--three times if the gods are kind--the\\nball rolls to the pavement. Flossie has been waiting so long for this\\nto happen. It is the bright moment of her life--the point and peak of\\nhappiness. She darts upon it. She paws it exultantly for a moment. Brief is\\nthe rainbow and brief the Borealis. The finger of Time is swift.\\n\\nThe poppy blooms and fades. The maid captures the ball of worsted and\\nrestores it.\\n\\nIt lies in the widow's lap. The band plays. The needles click to a long\\ntune. The healing waters trickle from the ground. The old woman whines\\ntheir merits. Flossie sits motionless, her head cocked and her eye upon the\\nball. Perhaps the god of puppies will again be good to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nROADS OF MORNING\\n\\n\\nMy grandfather's farm lay somewhere this side of the sunset, so near that\\nits pastures barely missed the splash of color. But from the city it was a\\ntwo hours' journey by horse and phaeton. My grandfather drove. I sat next,\\nmy feet swinging clear of the lunchbox. My brother had the outside, a place\\ndenied to me for fear that I might fall across the wheel. When we were\\nall set, my mother made a last dab at my nose--an unheeded smudge having\\nescaped my vigilance. Then my grandfather said, \\\"Get up,\\\"--twice, for the\\nlazy horse chose to regard the first summons as a jest. We start. The great\\nwheels turn. My brother leans across the guard to view the miracle. We\\ncrunch the gravel. We are alive for excitement. My brother plays we are\\na steamboat and toots. I toot in imitation, but higher up as if I were a\\nyounger sort of steamboat. We hold our hands on an imaginary wheel and\\nsteer. We scorn grocery carts and all such harbor craft. We are on a long\\ncruise. Street lights will guide us sailing home.\\n\\nOf course there were farms to the south of the city and apples may have\\nripened there to as fine a flavor, and to the east, also, doubtless there\\nwere farms. It would be asking too much that the west should have all the\\nhaystacks, cherry trees and cheese houses. If your judgment skimmed upon\\nthe surface, you would even have found the advantage with the south. It was\\nprettier because more rolling. It was shaggier. The country to the south\\ntipped up to the hills, so sharply in places that it might have made its\\nliving by collecting nickels for the slide. Indeed, one might think that a\\npart of the city had come bouncing down the slope, for now it lay resting\\nat the bottom, sprawled somewhat for its ease. Or it might appear--if your\\nbelief runs on discarded lines--that the whole flat-bottomed earth had been\\nfouled in its celestial course and now lay aslant upon its beam with its\\ncargo shifted and spilled about.\\n\\nThe city streets that led to the south, which in those days ended in lanes,\\npopped out of sight abruptly at the top of the first ridge. And when the\\nearth caught up again with their level, already it was dim and purple and\\ntall trees were no more than a roughened hedge. But what lay beyond that\\nrange of hills--what towns and cities--what oceans and forests--how beset\\nwith adventure--how fearful after dark--these things you could not see,\\neven if you climbed to some high place and strained yourself on tiptoe. And\\nif you walked from breakfast to lunch--until you gnawed within and were but\\na hollow drum--there would still be a higher range against the sky. There\\nare misty kingdoms on this whirling earth, but the ways are long and steep.\\n\\nThe lake lay to the north with no land beyond, the city to the east. But to\\nthe west--\\n\\nSeveral miles outside the city as it then was, and still beyond its\\nclutches, the country was cut by a winding river bottom with sharp edges of\\nshale. Down this valley Rocky River came brawling in the spring, over-fed\\nand quarrelsome. Later in the year--its youthful appetite having caught an\\nindigestion--it shrunk and wasted to a shadow. By August you could cross it\\non the stones. The uproar of its former flood was marked upon the shale and\\ntrunks of trees here and there were wedged, but now the river plays drowsy\\ntunes upon the stones. There is scarcely enough movement of water to flick\\nthe sunlight. A leaf on its idle current is a lazy craft whose skipper\\nnods. There were hickory trees on the point above. May-apples grew in the\\ndeep woods, and blackberries along the fences. And in the season sober\\nhorses plowed up and down the fields with nodding heads, affirming their\\nbelief in the goodness of the soil and their willingness to help in its\\nfruition.\\n\\nYet the very core of this valley in days past was a certain depth of water\\nat a turn of the stream. There was a clay bank above it and on it small\\nnaked boys stood and daubed themselves. One of them put a band of clay\\nabout himself by way of decoration. Another, by a more general smudge, made\\nhimself a Hottentot and thereby gave his manners a wider scope and license.\\nBut by daubing yourself entire you became an Indian and might vent yourself\\nin hideous yells, for it was amazing how the lungs grew stouter when the\\nclay was laid on thick. Then you tapped your flattened palm rapidly against\\nyour mouth and released an intermittent uproar in order that the valley\\nmight he warned of the deviltry to come. You circled round and round and\\nbeat upon the ground in the likeness of a war dance. But at last, sated\\nwith scalps, off you dived into the pool and came up a white man. Finally,\\nyou stood on one leg and jounced the water from your ear, or pulled a\\nbloodsucker from your toes before he sapped your life--for this tiny\\ncreature of the rocks was credited with the gift of prodigious inflation,\\nand might inhale you, blood, sinews, suspenders and all, if left to his\\nugly purpose.\\n\\nFarms should not be too precisely located; at least this is true of farms\\nwhich, like my grandfather's, hang in a mist of memory. I read once of a\\nwonderful spot--quite inferior, doubtless, to my grandfather's farm--which\\nwas located by evil directions intentionally to throw a seeker off.\\nMunchausen, you will recall, in the placing of his magic countries, was not\\nabove this agreeable villainy. Robinson Crusoe was loose and vague in the\\nplacing of his island. It is said that Izaak Walton waved a hand obscurely\\ntoward the stream where he had made a catch, but could not be cornered to a\\nnice direction, lest his pool be overrun. In early youth, I myself went, on\\na mischievous hint, to explore a remote region which I was told lay in the\\ndark behind the kindling pile. But because I moved in a fearful darkness,\\nquite beyond the pale light from the furnace room, I lost the path. It did\\nnot lead me to the peaks and the roaring waters.\\n\\nBut the farm was reached by more open methods. Dolly and the phaeton were\\nthe chief instruments. First--if you were so sunk in ignorance as not to\\nknow the road--you inquired of everybody for the chewing gum factory, to be\\nknown by its smell of peppermint. Then you sought the high bridge over the\\nrailroad tracks. Beyond was Kamm's Corners. Here, at a turn of the road,\\nwas a general store whose shelves sampled the produce of this whole fair\\nworld and the factories thereof. One might have thought that the proprietor\\nemulated Noah at the flood by bidding two of each created things to find a\\nplace inside.\\n\\nBeyond Kamm's Corners you came to the great valley. When almost down the\\nhill you passed a house with broken windows and unkept grass. This house,\\nby report, was haunted, but you could laugh at such tales while the morning\\nsun was up. At the bottom of the hill a bridge crossed the river, with\\nloose planking that rattled as though the man who made nails was dead.\\n\\nBeyond the bridge, at the first rise of ground, the horse stopped--for I\\nassume that you drove a sagacious animal--by way of hint that every one\\nof sound limb get out and walk to the top of the hill. A suspicious horse\\nturned his head now and again and cast his eye upon the buggy to be sure\\nthat no one climbed in again.\\n\\nPresently you came to the toll-gate at the top and paid its keeper five\\ncents, or whatever large sum he demanded. Then your grandfather--if by\\nfortunate chance you happened to have one--asked after his wife and\\nchildren, and had they missed the croup; then told him his corn was looking\\nwell.\\n\\nMy grandfather--for it is time you knew him--lived with us. Because of a\\nrailway accident fifteen years before in which one of his legs was cut off\\njust below the knee, he had retired from public office. Several years of\\nbroken health had been followed by years that were for the most part free\\nfrom suffering. My own first recollection reverts to these better years.\\nI recall a tall man--to my eyes a giant, for he was taller even than my\\nfather--who came into the nursery as I was being undressed. There was a\\nwind in the chimney, and the windows rattled. He put his crutches against\\nthe wall. Then taking me in his arms, he swung me aloft to his shoulder\\nby a series of somersaults. I cried this first time, but later I came to\\ndemand the performance.\\n\\nOnce, when I was a little older, I came upon one of his discarded wooden\\nlegs as I was playing in the garret of the house. It was my first\\nacquaintance with such a contrivance. It lay behind a pile of trunks and I\\nwas, at the time, on my way to the center of the earth, for the cheerful\\npath dove into darkness behind the chimney. You may imagine my surprise. I\\napproached it cautiously. I viewed it from all sides by such dusty light as\\nfell between the trunks. Not without fear I touched it. It was unmistakably\\na leg--but whose? Was it possible that there was a kind of Bluebeard in the\\nfamily, who, for his pleasure, lopped off legs? There had been no breath of\\nsuch a scandal. Yet, if my reading and studies were correct, such things\\nhad happened in other families not very different from ours; not in our own\\ntown maybe, but in such near-by places as Kandahar and Serendib--places\\nwhich in my warm regard were but as suburbs to our street, to be gained if\\nyou persevered for a hundred lamp-posts. Or could the leg belong to Annie\\nthe cook? Her nimbleness with griddle-cakes belied the thought: And once,\\nwhen the wind had swished her skirts, manifestly she was whole and sound.\\nThen all at once I knew it to be my grandfather's. Grown familiar, I pulled\\nit to the window. I tried it on, but made bad work of walking.\\n\\nTo the eye my grandfather had two legs all the way down and, except for\\nhis crutches and an occasional squeak, you would not have detected his\\ninfirmity. Evidently the maker did no more than imitate nature, although,\\nfor myself, I used to wonder at the poverty of his invention. There would\\nbe distinction in a leg, which in addition to its usual functions, would\\nalso bend forward at the knee, or had a surprising sidewise joint--and\\nthere would be profit, too, if one cared to make a show of it. The greatest\\nniggard on the street would pay two pins for such a sight.\\n\\nAs my grandfather was the only old gentleman of my acquaintance, a wooden\\nleg seemed the natural and suitable accompaniment of old age. Persons, it\\nappeared, in their riper years, cast off a leg, as trees dropped their\\nleaves. But my grandmother puzzled me. Undeniably she retained both of\\nhers, yet her hair was just as white, and she was almost as old. Evidently\\nthis law of nature worked only with men. Ladies, it seemed, were not\\ndeciduous. But how the amputation was effected in men--whether by day or\\nnight--how the choice fell between the right and left--whether the wooden\\nleg came down the chimney (a proper entrance)--how soon my father would go\\nthe way of all masculine flesh and cast his off--these matters I could not\\nsolve. The Arabian Nights were silent on the subject. Aladdin's uncle,\\napparently, had both his legs. He was too brisk in villainy to admit a\\nwooden leg. But then, he was only an uncle. If his history ran out to the\\nend, doubtless he would go with a limp in his riper days. The story of the\\nBible--although it trafficked in such veterans as Methuselah--gave not a\\nhint. Abraham died full of years. Here would have been a proper test--but\\nthe book was silent.\\n\\nMy grandfather in those days had much leisure time. He still kept an office\\nat the rear of the house, although he had given up the regular practice\\nof the law. But a few old clients lingered on, chiefly women who carried\\nchildren in their arms and old men without neckties who came to him for\\nfree advice. These he guided patiently in their troubles, and he would sit\\nan hour to listen to a piteous story. In an extremity he gave them money,\\nor took a well-meant but worthless note. Often his callers overran the\\ndinner hour and my mother would have to jingle the dinner bell at the door\\nto rouse them. Occasionally he would be called on for a public speech, and\\nfor several days he would be busy at his desk. Frequently he presided at\\ndinners and would tell a story and sing a song, for he had a fine bass\\nvoice and was famous for his singing.\\n\\nHe read much in those last years in science. When he was not reading\\nTrowbridge to his grandchildren, it was Huxley to himself. But when his\\neyes grew tired, he would on an occasion--if there was canning in the\\nhouse--go into the kitchen where my mother and grandmother worked, and help\\npare the fruit. Seriously, as though he were engaged upon a game, he would\\ncut the skin into thinnest strips, unbroken to the end, and would hold up\\nthe coil for us to see. Or if he broke it in the cutting it was a point\\nagainst him in the contest.\\n\\nHis diversion rather than his profit was the care and rental of about\\ntwenty small houses, some of which he built to fit his pensioners. My\\nbrother and myself often made the rounds with him in the phaeton. At most\\nof the houses he was affectionately greeted as \\\"Jedge\\\" and was held in long\\nconversations across the fence. And to see an Irishman was to see a friend.\\nThey all knew him and said, \\\"Good mornin',\\\" as we passed. He and they were\\ngood Democrats together.\\n\\nI can see in memory a certain old Irishman in a red flannel shirt, with his\\nfoot upon the hub, bending across the wheel and gesticulating in an endless\\ndiscussion of politics or crops, while my brother and I were impatient to\\nbe off. Dolly was of course patient, for she had long since passed her\\nfretful youth. If by any biological chance it had happened that she had\\nbeen an old lady instead of a horse, she would have been the kind that\\nspent her day in a rocker with her knitting. Any one who gave Dolly an\\nexcuse for standing was her friend. There she stood as though she wished\\nthe colloquy to last forever.\\n\\nIt was seldom that Dolly lost her restraint. She would, indeed, when she\\ncame near the stable, somewhat hasten her stride; and when we came on our\\ndrives to the turning point and at last headed about for home, Dolly would\\nknow it and show her knowledge by a quickening of the ears and the quiver\\nof a faint excitement. Yet Dolly lost her patience when there were flies.\\nThen she threw off all repression and so waved her tail that she regularly\\ngot it across the reins. This stirred my grandfather to something not\\nfar short of anger. How vigorously would he try to dislodge the reins\\nby pulling and jerking! Dolly only clamped down her tail the harder.\\nExperience showed that the only way was to go slowly and craftily and\\nwithout heat or temper--a slackening of the reins--a distraction of Dolly's\\nattention--a leaning across the dashboard--a firm grasping of the tail out\\nnear the end--a sudden raising thereof. Ah! It was done. We all settled\\nback against the cushions. Or perhaps a friendly fly would come to our\\nassistance and Dolly would have to use her tail in another direction.\\n\\nThe whip was seldom used. Generally it stood in its socket. It was\\nornamental like a flagstaff. It forgot its sterner functions. But Dolly\\nmust have known the whip in some former life, for even a gesture toward the\\nsocket roused her. If it was rattled she mended her pace for a block. But\\nif on a rare occasion my grandfather took it in his hand, Dolly lay one ear\\nback in our direction, for she knew then he meant business. And what an\\nexcitement would arise in the phaeton! We held on tight for fear that she\\nmight take it into her mild old head to run away.\\n\\nBut Dolly had her moments. One sunny summer afternoon while she grazed\\npeacefully in the orchard, with her reins wound around the whip handle--the\\nappropriate place on these occasions--she was evidently stung by a bee. My\\nbrother was at the time regaling himself in a near-by blackberry thicket.\\nHe looked up at an unusual sound. Without warning, Dolly had leaped to\\naction and was tearing around the orchard dragging the phaeton behind\\nher. She wrecked the top on a low hanging branch, then hit another tree,\\nsevering thereby all connection between herself and the phaeton, and at\\nlast galloped down the lane to the farm house, with the broken shafts and\\nharness dangling behind her. Kipling's dun \\\"with the mouth of a bell and\\nthe heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-tree,\\\" could hardly have\\nshown more spirit. It was as though one brief minute of a glorious youth\\nhad come back to her. It was a last spurting of an old flame before it sunk\\nto ash.\\n\\nMy grandfather gave his leisure to his grandchildren. He carved for us with\\nhis knife, with an especial knack for willow whistles. He showed us the\\ncolors that lay upon the world when we looked at it through one of the\\nglass pendants of the parlor chandelier. He sat by us when we played\\nduck-on-the-rock. He helped us with our kites and gave a superintendence to\\nour toys. It is true that he was superficial with tin-tags and did not know\\nthe difference in value between a Steam Engine tag--the rarest of them\\nall--and a common Climax, but we forgave him as one forgives a friend who\\nis ignorant of Persian pottery. He employed us as gardeners and put a\\nbounty on weeds. We watered the lawn together, turn by turn. When I was\\nno more than four years old, he taught us to play casino with him--and\\nafterwards bezique. How he cried out if he got a royal sequence! With what\\nexcitement he announced a double bezique! Or if one of us seemed about to\\nscore and lacked but a single card, how intently he contended for the last\\nfew tricks to thwart our declaration! And if we got it despite his lead\\nof aces, how gravely he squinted on the cards against deception, with his\\nglasses forward on his nose!\\n\\nWhen he took his afternoon nap and lay upon his back on the sofa in the\\nsitting-room, we made paper pin-wheels to see whether his breath would\\nstir them. This trick having come to his notice by a sudden awakening, he\\nsometimes thereafter played to be asleep and snored in such a mighty gust\\nthat the wheels spun. He was like a Dutch tempest against a windmill.\\n\\nIf a Dime Museum came to town we made an afternoon of it. He took us to all\\nthe circuses and gave us our choice of side-shows. We walked up and\\ndown before the stretches of painted canvas, balancing in our desire a\\nsword-swallower against an Indian Princess. Most of the fat women and all\\nthe dwarfs that I have known came to my acquaintance when in company with\\nmy grandfather. As a young man, it was said, he once ran away from home to\\njoin a circus as an acrobat, having acquired the trick of leaping upon a\\nrunning horse. I fancy that his knack of throwing us to his shoulder by a\\ndouble somersault was a recollection of his early days. You may imagine\\nwith what awe we looked on him even though he now went on crutches. He was\\nthe epitome of adventure, the very salt of excitement. It was better having\\nhim than a pirate in the house. When the circus had gone and life was drab,\\nhe was our tutor in the art of turning cart-wheels and making hand-stands\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nAnd once, when we were away from him, he walked all morning about the\\ngarden and in his loneliness he gathered into piles the pebbles that we had\\ndropped.\\n\\nI was too young to know my grandfather in his active days when he was\\nprominent in public matters. His broader abilities are known to others. But\\nthough more than twenty years have passed since his death, I remember his\\ntone of voice, his walk, his way of handling a crutch, all his tricks of\\nspeech and conduct as though he had just left the room. And I can think of\\nnothing more beautiful than that a useful man who has faced the world for\\nseventy years and has done his part, should come back in his old age to the\\nnursery and be the playfellow of his grandchildren.\\n\\nBut the best holiday was a trip to the farm.\\n\\nThis farm--to which in our slow trot we have been so long a time in\\ncoming--lay for a mile on the upper land, and its grain fields and pastures\\nlooked down into the valley. The buildings, however, were set close to the\\nroad and fixed their interest on such occasional wagons as creaked by. A\\nSwitzer occupied the farm, who owned, in addition to the more immediate\\nmembers of his family, a cuckoo clock whose weights hung on long cords\\nwhich by Saturday night reached almost to the floor. When I have sat at his\\ntable, I have neglected cheese and the lesser foods, when the hour came\\nnear, in order not to miss the cuckoo's popping out. And in the duller\\nspaces, when the door was shut, I have fancied it sitting in the dark and\\ncounting the minutes to itself.\\n\\nThe Switzer's specialty was the making of a kind of rubber cheese which one\\ncould learn to like in time. Of the processes of its composition, I can\\nremember nothing except that when it was in the great press the whey ran\\nfrom its sides, but this may be common to all cheeses. I was once given a\\ncup of this whey to drink and I brightened, for until it was in my mouth,\\nI thought it was buttermilk. Beyond was the spring-house with cans of milk\\nset in the cool water and with a trickling sound beneath the boards. From\\nthe spring-house there started those mysterious cow-paths that led down\\ninto the great gorge that cut the farm. Here were places so deep that only\\na bit of the sky showed and here the stones were damp. It was a place that\\nseemed to lie nearer to the confusion when the world was made, and rocks\\nlay piled as though a first purpose had been broken off. And to follow a\\ncow-path, regardless of where it led, was, in those days, the essence of\\nhazard; though all the while from the pastures up above there came the flat\\nsafe tinkling of the bells.\\n\\nThe apple orchard--where Dolly was stung by the bee--was set on a fine\\nbreezy place at the brow of the hill with the valley in full sight. The\\ntrees themselves were old and decayed, but they were gnarled and crotched\\nfor easy climbing. And the apples--in particular a russet--mounted to a\\ndelicacy. On the other side of the valley, a half mile off as a bird would\\nfly, were the buildings of a convent, and if you waited you might hear\\nthe twilight bell. To this day all distant bells come to my ears with a\\npleasing softness, as though they had been cast in a quieter world. Stone\\narrow-heads were found in a near-by field as often as the farmer turned up\\nthe soil in plowing. And because of this, a long finger of land that put\\noff to the valley, was called Indian Point. Here, with an arm for pillow,\\none might lie for a long hour on a sunny morning and watch the shadows of\\nclouds move across the lowland. A rooster crows somewhere far off--surely\\nof all sounds the drowsiest. A horse in a field below lifts up its head and\\nneighs. The leaves practice a sleepy tune. If one has the fortune to keep\\nawake, here he may lie and think the thoughts that are born of sun and\\nwind.\\n\\nAnd now, although it is not yet noon, hunger rages in us. The pancakes, the\\nsyrup, the toast and the other incidents of breakfast have disappeared\\nthe way the rabbit vanishes when the magician waves his hand. The horrid\\nPolyphemus did not so crave his food. And as yet there is no comforting\\nsniff from the kitchen. Scrubbing and other secular matters engage the\\nfarmer's wife. There is as yet not a faintest gurgle in the kettle.\\n\\nTo divert ourselves, we climb three trees and fall out of one. Is twelve\\no'clock never to come? Have Time and the Hour grown stagnant? We eat apples\\nand throw the cores at the pig to hear him grunt. Is the great round sun\\nstuck? Have the days of Joshua come again? We walk a rail fence. Is it not\\nyet noon? Shrewsbury clock itself--reputed by scholars the slowest of all\\npossible clocks--could not so hold off. I snag myself--but it is nothing\\nthat shows when I sit.\\n\\nAh! At last! My grandfather is calling from the house. We run back and\\nfind that the lunch is ready and is laid upon a table with a red oil-cloth\\ncover. We apply ourselves. Silence....\\n\\nThe journey home started about five o'clock. There was one game we always\\nplayed. Each of us, having wisely squinted at the sky, made a reckoning and\\nguessed where we would be when the sun set. My grandfather might say the\\nhigh bridge. I named the Sherman House. But my brother, being precise,\\njudged it to a fraction of a telegraph pole. Beyond a certain turn--did we\\nremember?--well, it would be exactly sixteen telegraph poles further on.\\nWhat an excitement there was when the sun's lower rim was already below the\\nhorizon! We stood on our knees and looked through the little window at\\nthe back of the phaeton. With what suspicion we regarded my grandfather's\\ndriving! Or if Dolly lagged, did it not raise a thought that she, too, was\\nin the plot against us? The sun sets. We cry out the victor.\\n\\nThe sky flames with color. Then deadens in the east. The dusk is falling.\\nThe roads grow dark. Where run the roads of night? While there is light,\\nyou can see the course they keep across the country--the dust of horses'\\nfeet--a bridge--a vagrant winding on a hill beyond. All day long they are\\nbusy with the feet of men and women and children shouting. Then twilight\\ncomes, and the roads lead home to supper and the curling smoke above the\\nroof. But at night where run the roads? It's dark beyond the candle's\\nflare--where run the roads of night.\\n\\nMy brother and I have become sleepy. We lop over against my grandfather--\\n\\nWe awake with a start. There is a gayly lighted horse-car jingling beside\\nus. The street lights show us into harbor. We are home at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man Of Grub Street Comes From His Garret\\n\\n\\nI have come to live this winter in New York City and by good fortune I\\nhave found rooms on a pleasant park. This park, which is but one block in\\nextent, is so set off from the thoroughfares that it bears chiefly the\\ntraffic that is proper to the place itself. Grocery carts jog around and\\nthrow out their wares. Laundry wagons are astir. A little fat tailor on an\\noccasion carries in an armful of newly pressed clothing with suspenders\\nhanging. Dogs are taken out to walk but are held in leash, lest a taste of\\nliberty spoil them for an indoor life. The center of the park is laid out\\nwith grass and trees and pebbled paths, and about it is a high iron fence.\\nEach house has a key to the enclosure. Such social infection, therefore, as\\ngets inside the gates is of our own breeding. In the sunny hours nurses and\\nchildren air themselves in this grass plot. Here a gayly painted wooden\\nvelocipede is in fashion. At this minute there are several pairs of fat\\nlegs a-straddle this contrivance. It is a velocipede as it was first made,\\nwithout pedals. Beau Brummel--for the velocipede dates back to him--may\\nhave walked forth to take the waters at Tunbridge Wells on a vehicle not\\nfar different, but built to his greater stature. There is also a trickle\\nof drays and wagons across the park--a mere leakage from the streets, as\\nthough the near-by traffic in the pressure had burst its pipes. But only at\\nmorning and night when the city collects or discharges its people, are the\\nsidewalks filled. Then for a half hour the nozzle of the city plays a full\\nstream on us.\\n\\nThe park seems to be freer and more natural than the streets outside. A man\\ngoes by gesticulating as though he practiced for a speech. A woman adjusts\\nher stocking on the coping below the fence with the freedom of a country\\nroad. A street sweeper, patched to his office, tunes his slow work to fit\\nthe quiet surroundings. Boys skate by or cut swirls upon the pavement in\\nthe privilege of a playground.\\n\\nMy work--if anything so pleasant and unforced can carry the name--is\\ndone at a window that overlooks this park. Were it not for several high\\nbuildings in my sight I might fancy that I lived in one of the older\\nsquares of London. There is a look of Thackeray about the place as though\\nthe Osbornes might be my neighbors. A fat man who waddles off his steps\\nopposite, if he would submit to a change of coat, might be Jos Sedley\\nstarting for his club to eat his chutney. If only there were a crest above\\nmy bell-pull I might even expect Becky Sharp in for tea. Or occasionally I\\ndivert myself with the fancy that I am of a still older day and that I have\\nwalked in from Lichfield--I choose the name at hazard--with a tragedy in my\\npocket, to try my fortune. Were it not for the fashion of dress in the park\\nbelow and some remnant of reason in myself, I could, in a winking moment,\\npersuade myself that my room is a garret and my pen a quill. On such\\ndelusion, before I issued on the street to seek my coffee-house, I would\\nadjust my wig and dust myself of snuff.\\n\\nBut for my exercise and recreation--which for a man of Grub Street is\\nnecessary in the early hours of afternoon when the morning fires have\\nfallen--I go outside the park. I have a wide choice for my wanderings. I\\nmay go into the district to the east and watch the children play against\\nthe curb. If they pitch pennies on the walk I am careful to go about, for\\nfear that I distract the throw. Or if the stones are marked for hop-scotch,\\nI squeeze along the wall. It is my intention--from which as yet my\\ndiffidence withholds me--to present to the winner of one of these contests\\na red apple which I shall select at a corner stand. Or an ice wagon pauses\\nin its round, and while the man is gone there is a pleasant thieving of\\nbits of ice. Each dirty cheek is stuffed as though a plague of mumps had\\nfallen on the street. Or there may be a game of baseball--a scampering\\non the bases, a home-run down the gutter--to engage me for an inning.\\nOr shinny grips the street. But if a street organ comes--not a mournful\\none-legged box eked out with a monkey, but a big machine with an extra man\\nto pull--the children leave their games. It was but the other day that I\\nsaw six of them together dancing on the pavement to the music, with skirts\\nand pigtails flying. There was such gladness in their faces that the\\nmusician, although he already had his nickel, gave them an extra tune. It\\nwas of such persuasive gayety that the number of dancers at once went up to\\nten and others wiggled to the rhythm. And for myself, although I am past my\\nsportive days, the sound of a street organ, if any, would inflame me to a\\nfox-trot. Even a surly tune--if the handle be quickened--comes from the box\\nwith a brisk seduction. If a dirge once got inside, it would fret until it\\ncame out a dancing measure.\\n\\nIn this part of town, on the better streets, I sometimes study the fashions\\nas I see them in the shops and I compare them with those of uptown stores.\\nNor is there the difference one might suppose. The small round muff that\\nsprang up this winter in the smarter shops won by only a week over the\\ncheaper stores. Tan gaiters ran a pretty race. And I am now witness to\\na dead heat in a certain kind of fluffy rosebud dress. The fabrics are\\nprobably different, but no matter how you deny it, they are cut to a common\\npattern.\\n\\nIn a poorer part of the city still nearer to the East River, where\\nsmells of garlic and worse issue from cellarways, I came recently on\\na considerable park. It was supplied with swings and teeters and drew\\nchildren on its four fronts. Of a consequence the children of many races\\nplayed together. I caught a Yiddish answer to an Italian question. I fancy\\nthat a child here could go forth at breakfast wholly a Hungarian and come\\nhome with a smack of Russian or Armenian added. The general games that\\nmerged the smaller groups, aided in the fusion. If this park is not already\\nnamed--a small chance, for it shows the marks of age--it might properly be\\ncalled _The Park of the Thirty Nations_.\\n\\nOr my inclination may take me to the lower city. Like a poor starveling\\nI wander in the haunts of wealth where the buildings are piled to forty\\nstories, and I spin out the ciphers in my brain in an endeavor to compute\\nthe amount that is laid up inside. Also, lest I become discontented with my\\npoverty, I note the strain and worry of the faces that I meet. There is a\\nstory of Tolstoi in which a man is whispered by his god that he may possess\\nsuch land as he can circle in a day. Until that time he had been living on\\na fertile slope of sun and shadow, with fields ample for his needs. But\\nwhen the whisper came, at a flash, he pelted off across the hills. He ran\\nall morning, but as the day advanced his sordid ambition broadened and he\\nturned his course into a wider and still wider circle. Here a pleasant\\nvalley tempted him and he bent his path to bring it inside his mark. Here\\na fruitful upland led him off. As the day wore on he ran with a greater\\nfierceness, because he knew he would lose everything if he did not reach\\nhis starting place before the sun went down. The sun was coming near the\\nrim of earth when he toiled up the last hill. His feet were cut by stones,\\nhis face pinched with agony. He staggered toward the goal and fell across\\nit while as yet there was a glint of light. But his effort burst his heart.\\nDoes the analogy hold on these narrow streets? To a few who sit in an inner\\noffice, Mammon has made a promise of wealth and domination. These few run\\nbreathless to gain a mountain. But what have the gods whispered to the ten\\nthousand who sit in the outer office, that they bend and blink upon their\\nledgers? Have the gods whispered to them the promise of great wealth? Alas,\\nbefore them there lies only the dust and heat of a level road, yet they too\\nare broken at the sunset.\\n\\nLess oppressive are the streets where commerce is more apparent. Here,\\nunless you would be smirched, it is necessary to walk fast and hold your\\ncoat-tails in. Packing cases are going down slides. Bales are coming up in\\nhoists. Barrels are rolling out of wagons. Crates are being lifted in. Is\\nthe exchange never to stop? Is no warehouse satisfied with what it has?\\nEnglish, which until now you judged a soft concordant language, shows here\\nits range and mastery of epithet. And all about, moving and jostling the\\nboxes, are men with hooks. One might think that in a former day Captain\\nCuttle had settled here to live and that his numerous progeny had kept the\\nplace.\\n\\nOften I ride on a bus top like a maharajah on an elephant, up near the\\ntusks, as it were, where the view is unbroken. I plan this trip so that I\\nmove counter to the procession that goes uptown in the late afternoon. Is\\nthere a scene like it in the world? The boulevards of Paris in times of\\npeace are hardly so gay. Fifth Avenue is blocked with motor cars. Fashion\\nhas gone forth to select a feather. A ringlet has gone awry and must be\\nmended. The Pomeranian's health is served by sunlight. The Spitz must have\\nan airing. Fashion has wagged its head upon a Chinese vase--has indeed\\nsquinted at it through a lorgnette against a fleck--and now lolls home to\\ndinner. Or style has veered an inch, and it has been a day of fitting. At\\nrestaurant windows one may see the feeding of the over-fed. Men sit in club\\nwindows and still wear their silk hats as though there was no glass between\\nthem and the windy world. Footmen in boots and breeches sit as stiffly as\\nthough they were toys grown large and had metal spikes below to hold them\\nto their boxes. They look like the iron firemen that ride on nursery\\nfire-engines. For all these sights the bus top is the best place.\\n\\nAnd although we sit on a modest roof, the shopkeepers cater to us. For in\\nmany of the stores, is there not an upper tier of windows for our use? The\\ncommodities of this second story are quite as fine as those below. And the\\nwaxen beauties who display the frocks greet us in true democracy with as\\nsweet a simper.\\n\\nMy friend G---- while riding recently on a bus top met with an experience\\nfor which he still blushes.\\n\\nThere was a young woman sitting directly in front of him, and when he came\\nto leave, a sudden lurch threw him against her. When he recovered his\\nfooting, which was a business of some difficulty, for the bus pitched upon\\na broken pavement, what was his chagrin to find that a front button of\\nhis coat had hooked in her back hair! Luckily G---- was not seized with a\\npanic. Rather, he labored cautiously--but without result. Nor could\\nshe help in the disentanglement. Their embarrassment might have been\\nindefinitely prolonged--indeed, G---- was several blocks already down the\\nstreet--when he bethought him of his knife and so cut off the button. As he\\npleasantly expressed it to the young woman, he would give her the choice of\\nthe button or the coat entire.\\n\\nReader, are you inclined toward ferry boats? I cannot include those persons\\nwho journey on them night and morning perfunctorily. These persons keep\\ntheir noses in their papers or sit snugly in the cabin. If the market is\\nup, they can hardly be conscious even that they are crossing a river.\\nNor do I entirely blame them. If one kept shop on a breezy tip of the\\nDelectable Mountains with all the regions of the world laid out below,\\nhe could not be expected to climb up for the hundredth time with a first\\nexhilaration, or to swing his alpenstock as though he were on a rare\\nholiday. If one had business across the Styx too often--although the\\nscenery on its banks is reputed to be unusual--he might in time sit below\\nand take to yawning. Father Charon might have to jog his shoulder to rouse\\nhim when the boat came between the further piers.\\n\\nBut are you one of those persons who, not being under a daily compulsion,\\nrides upon a ferry boat for the love of the trip? Being in this class\\nmyself, I laid my case the other night before the gateman, and asked\\nhis advice regarding routes. He at once entered sympathetically into my\\ndistemper and gave me a plan whereby with but a single change of piers\\nI might at an expense of fourteen cents cross the river four times at\\ndifferent angles.\\n\\nIt was at the end of day and a light fog rested on the water. Nothing was\\nentirely lost, yet a gray mystery wrapped the ships and buildings. If New\\nJersey still existed it was dim and shadowy as though its real life had\\ngone and but a ghost remained. Ferry boats were lighted in defiance of the\\nmurk, and darted here and there at reckless angles. An ocean liner was\\nputting out, and several tugs had rammed their noses against her sides.\\nThere is something engaging about a tug. It snorts with eagerness. It kicks\\nand splashes. It bursts itself to lend a hand. And how it butts with its\\nnose! Surely its forward cartilages are of triple strength, else in its\\nzest it would jam its nasal passages.\\n\\nPresently we came opposite lower New York. Although the fog concealed the\\noutlines of the buildings, their lights showed through. This first hour of\\ndark is best, before the day's work is done and while as yet all of the\\nwindows are lighted. The Woolworth Tower was suffused in a soft and shadowy\\nlight. The other buildings showed like mountains of magic pin-pricks. It\\nwas as though all the constellations of heaven on a general bidding had met\\nfor conference.\\n\\nThe man of Grub Street, having by this time somewhat dispelled the fumes of\\ndullness from his head, descends from his ferry boat and walks to his quiet\\npark. There is a dull roar from the elevated railway on Third Avenue where\\nthe last of the day's crowd goes home. The sidewalks are becoming empty.\\nThere is a sheen of water on the pavement. In the winter murk there is a\\nlook of Thackeray about the place as though the Sedleys or the Osbornes\\nmight be his neighbors. If there were a crest above his bell-pull he might\\neven expect Becky Sharp in for tea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow that Spring is here\\n\\n\\nWhen the sun set last night it was still winter. The persons who passed\\nnorthward in the dusk from the city's tumult thrust their hands deep into\\ntheir pockets and walked to a sharp measure. But a change came in the\\nnight. The north wind fell off and a breeze blew up from the south. Such\\nstars as were abroad at dawn left off their shrill winter piping--if it be\\ntrue that stars really sing in their courses--and pitched their voices to\\nApril tunes. One star in particular that hung low in the west until the day\\nwas up, knew surely that the Spring had come and sang in concert with the\\nearliest birds. There is a dull belief that these early birds shake off\\ntheir sleep to get the worm. Rather, they come forth at this hour to cock\\ntheir ears upon the general heavens for such new tunes as the unfaded\\nstars still sing. If an ear is turned down to the rummage of worms in the\\nearth--for to the superficial, so does the attitude attest--it is only that\\nthe other ear may be turned upward to catch the celestial harmonies; for\\nbirds know that if there is an untried melody in heaven it will sound first\\nacross the clear pastures of the dawn. All the chirping and whistling\\nfrom the fields and trees are then but the practice of the hour. When the\\nmeadowlark sings on a fence-rail she but cons her lesson from the stars.\\n\\nIt is on such a bright Spring morning that the housewife, duster in hand,\\nthrows open her parlor window and looks upon the street. A pleasant park is\\nbelow, of the size of a city square, and already it stirs with the day's\\nactivity. The housewife beats her cloth upon the sill and as the dust flies\\noff, she hears the cries and noises of the place. In a clear tenor she\\nis admonished that there is an expert hereabouts to grind her knives. A\\nswarthy baritone on a wagon lifts up his voice in praise of radishes and\\ncarrots. His eye roves along the windows. The crook of a hungry finger will\\nbring him to a stand. Or a junkman is below upon his business. Yesterday\\nthe bells upon his cart would have sounded sour, but this morning they\\nrattle agreeably, as though a brisker cow than common, springtime in her\\nhoofs, were jangling to her pasture. At the sound--if you are of country\\ntraining--you see yourself, somewhat misty through the years, barefoot in a\\ngrassy lane, with stick in hand, urging the gentle beast. There is a subtle\\npersuasion in the junkman's call. In these tones did the magician, bawling\\nfor old lamps, beguile Aladdin. If there were this morning in my lodging an\\nunrubbed lamp, I would toss it from the window for such magic as he might\\nextract from it. And if a fair Princess should be missing at the noon and\\nher palace be skipped from sight, it will follow on the rubbing of it.\\n\\nThe call of red cherries in the park--as you might guess from its Italian\\nsource--is set to an amorous tune. What lady, smocked in morning cambric,\\nwould not be wooed by such a voice? The gay fellow tempts her to a\\npurchase. It is but a decent caution--now that Spring is here--that the\\nrascal does not call his wares by moonlight. As for early peas this\\nmorning, it is Pan himself who peddles them--disguised and smirched lest\\nhe be caught in the deception--Pan who stamps his foot and shakes the\\nthicket--whose habit is to sing with reedy voice of the green willows that\\ndip in sunny waters. Although he now clatters his tins and baskets and\\ncries out like a merchant, his thoughts run to the black earth and the\\nshady hollows and the sound of little streams.\\n\\nI have wondered as I have observed the housewives lingering at their\\nwindows--for my window also looks upon the park--I have wondered that these\\nmelodious street cries are not used generally for calling the wares of\\nwider sale. If a radish can be so proclaimed, there might be a lilt devised\\nin praise of other pleasing merceries--a tripping pizzicato for laces and\\nfrippery--a brave trumpeting for some newest cereal. And should not the\\nlatest book--if it be a tale of love, for these I am told are best offered\\nto the public in the Spring (sad tales are best for winter)--should not a\\ntale of love be heralded through the city by the singing of a ballad, with\\na melting tenor in the part? In old days a gaudy rogue cried out upon the\\nbroader streets that jugglers had stretched their rope in the market-place,\\nbut when the bears came to town, the news was piped even to the narrowest\\nlanes that house-folk might bring their pennies.\\n\\nWith my thoughts set on the Spring I chanced to walk recently where the\\ntheatres are thickest. It was on a Saturday afternoon and the walk was\\ncrowded with amusement seekers. Presently in the press I observed a queer\\nold fellow carrying on his back a monstrous pack of umbrellas. He rang\\na bell monotonously and professed himself a mender of umbrellas. He can\\nhardly have expected to find a customer in the crowd. Even a blinking\\neye--and these street merchants are shrewd in these matters--must have told\\nhim that in all this hurrying mass of people, the thoughts of no one ran\\ntoward umbrellas. Rather, I think that he was taking an hour from the\\nroutine of the day. He had trod the profitable side streets until truantry\\nhad taken him. But he still made a pretext of working at his job and called\\nhis wares to ease his conscience from idleness. Once when an unusually\\nbright beam of sunlight fell from between the clouds, he tilted up his hat\\nto get the warmth and I thought him guilty of a skip and syncopation in the\\nringing of his bell, as if he too twitched pleasantly with the Spring and\\nhis old sap was stirred.\\n\\nI like these persons who ply their trades upon the sidewalk. My hatter--the\\nfellow who cleans my straw hat each Spring--is a partner of a bootblack.\\nOver his head as he putters with his soap and brushes, there hangs a rusty\\nsign proclaiming that he is famous for his cleaning all round the world. He\\nis so modest in his looks that I have wondered whether he really can read\\nthe sign. Or perhaps like a true merchant, he is not squeamish at the\\npraise. As I have not previously been aware that any of his profession ever\\ncame to general fame except the Mad Hatter of Wonderland, I have squinted\\nsharply at him to see if by chance it might be he, but there are no marks\\neven of a distant kinship. He does, however, bring my hat to a marvellous\\nwhiteness and it may be true that he has really tended heads that are now\\ngone beyond Constantinople.\\n\\nBootblacks have a sense of rhythm unparalleled. Of this the long rag is\\ntheir instrument. They draw it once or twice across the shoe to set the key\\nand then they go into a swift and pattering melody. If there is an unusual\\ngenius in the bootblack--some remnant of ancient Greece--he plays such a\\nlively tune that one's shoulders jig to it. If there were a dryad or other\\nsuch nimble creature on the street, she would come leaping as though\\nOrpheus strummed a tune, but the dance is too fast for our languid northern\\nfeet.\\n\\nNowhere are apples redder than on a cart. Our hearts go out to Adam in the\\nhour of his temptation. I know one lady of otherwise careful appetite who\\neven leans toward dates if she may buy them from a cart. \\\"Those dear dirty\\ndates,\\\" she calls them, but I cannot share her liking for them. Although\\nthe cart is a beguiling market, dates so bought are too dusty to be eaten.\\nThey rank with the apple-john. The apple-john is that mysterious leathery\\nfruit, sold more often from a stand than from a cart, which leans at the\\nrear of the shelf against the peppermint jars. For myself, although I do\\nnot eat apple-johns, I like to look at them. They are so shrivelled and so\\nflat, as though a banana had caught a consumption. Or rather, in the older\\nworld was there not a custom at a death of sending fruits to support the\\nlonesome journey? If so, the apple-john came untasted to the end. Indeed,\\nthere is a look of old Egypt about the fruit. Whether my fondness for\\ngazing at apple-johns springs from a distant occasion when as a child I\\nonce bought and ate one, or whether it arises from the fact that Falstaff\\ncalled Prince Hal a dried apple-john, is an unsolved question, but I like\\nto linger before a particularly shrivelled one and wonder what its youth\\nwas like. Perhaps like many of its betters, it remained unheralded and\\nunknown all through its fresher years and not until the coming of its\\nwrinkled age was it at last put up to the common view. The apple-john sets\\nup kinship with an author.\\n\\nThe day of all fools is wisely put in April. The jest of the day resides in\\nthe success with which credulity is imposed upon, and April is the month of\\neasiest credulity. Let bragging travellers come in April and hold us with\\ntales of the Anthropopagi! If their heads are said to grow beneath their\\nshoulders, still we will turn a credent ear. Indeed, it is all but sure\\nthat Baron Munchausen came back from his travels in the Spring. When\\nelse could he have got an ear? What man can look upon the wonders of the\\nreturning year--the first blue skies, the soft rains, the tender sproutings\\nof green stalks without feeling that there is nothing beyond belief? If\\nsuch miracles can happen before his eyes, shall not the extreme range even\\nof travel or metaphysics be allowed? What man who has smelled the first\\nfragrance of the earth, has heard the birds on their northern flight and\\nhas seen an April brook upon its course, will withhold his credence even\\nthough the jest be plain?\\n\\nI beg, therefore, that when you walk upon the street on the next day of\\nApril fool, that you yield to the occasion. If an urchin points his finger\\nat your hat, humor him by removing it! Look sharply at it for a supposed\\ndefect! His glad shout will be your reward. Or if you are begged piteously\\nto lift a stand-pipe wrapped to the likeness of a bundle, even though you\\nsniff the imposture, seize upon it with a will! It is thus, beneath these\\nApril skies, that you play your part in the pageantry that marks the day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Friendly Genii\\n\\n\\nDo you not confess yourself to be several years past that time of greenest\\nyouth when burnt cork holds its greatest charm? Although not fallen to a\\ncrippled state, are you not now too advanced to smudge your upper lip and\\nstalk agreeably as a villain? Surely you can no longer frisk lightly in\\na comedy. If you should wheeze and limp in an old man's part, with back\\nhumped in mimicry, would you not fear that it bordered on the truth? But\\ndoubtless there was a time when you ranged upon these heights--when Kazrac\\nthe magician was not too heavy for your art. In those soaring days, let us\\nhope that you played the villain with a swagger, or being cast in a softer\\nrole, that you won a pink and fluffy princess before the play was done.\\nYour earliest practice, it may be, was in rigging the parlor hangings as a\\ncurtain with brown string from the pantry and safety pins. Although you had\\nno show to offer, you said \\\"ding\\\" three times--as is the ancient custom of\\nthe stage when the actors are ready--and drew them wide apart. The cat\\nwas the audience, who dozed with an ear twitching toward your activity. A\\ncomplaint that springs up in youth and is known as \\\"snuffles\\\" had kept you\\nout of school. It had gripped you hard at breakfast, when you were sunk in\\nfear of your lessons, but had abated at nine o'clock. Whether the cure came\\nwith a proper healing of the nasal glands or followed merely on the ringing\\nof the school bell, must be left to a cool judgment.\\n\\nYour theatre filled the morning. When Annie came on her quest for dust, you\\ntooted once upon your nose, just to show that a remnant of your infirmity\\npersisted, then put your golden convalescence on the making of your\\ncurtain.\\n\\nBut in the early hours of afternoon when the children are once more upon\\nthe street, you regret your illness. Here they come trooping by threes and\\nfours, carrying their books tied up in straps. One would think that they\\nwere in fear lest some impish fact might get outside the covers to spoil\\nthe afternoon. Until the morrow let two and two think themselves five at\\nleast! And let Ohio be bounded as it will! Some few children skip ropes, or\\nstep carefully across the cracks of the sidewalk for fear they spoil their\\nsuppers. Ah!--a bat goes by--a glove--a ball! And now from a vacant lot\\nthere comes the clamor of choosing sides. Is no mention to be made of\\nyou--you, \\\"molasses fingers\\\"--the star left fielder--the timely batter?\\nWhat would you not give now for a clean bill of health? You rub your\\noffending nose upon the glass. What matters it with what deep rascality in\\nblack mustachios you once strutted upon your boards? What is Hecuba to you?\\n\\nMy own first theatre was in the attic, a place of squeaks and shadows\\nto all except the valiant. In it were low, dark corners where the night\\ncrawled in and slept. But in the open part where the roof was highest,\\nthere was the theatre. Its walls were made of a red cambric of a flowered\\npattern that still lingers with me, and was bought with a clatter of\\npennies on the counter, together with nickels that had escaped my\\nextravagance at the soda fountain.\\n\\nA cousin and I were joint proprietors. In the making of it, the hammer and\\nnails were mine by right of sex, while she stitched in womanish fashion on\\nthe fabrics. She was leading woman and I was either the hero or the villain\\nas fitted to my mood. My younger cousin--although we scorned her for her\\nyouth--was admitted to the slighter parts. She might daub herself with\\ncork, but it must be only when we were done. Nor did we allow her to carry\\nthe paper knife--shaped like a dagger--which figured hugely in our plots.\\nIf we gave her any word to speak, it was as taffy to keep her silent about\\nsome iniquity that we had worked against her. In general, we judged her to\\nbe too green and giddy for the heavy parts. At the most, she might take\\npins at the door--for at such a trifle we displayed our talents--or play\\nupon the comb as orchestra before the rising of the curtain.\\n\\nThe usual approach to this theatre was the kitchen door, and those who came\\nto enjoy the drama sniffed at their very entrance the new-baked bread. A\\npan of cookies was set upon a shelf and a row of apples was ranged along\\nthe window sill. Of the ice-box around the corner, not a word, lest hunger\\nlead you off! As for the cook, although her tongue was tart upon a just\\noccasion and although she shooed the children with her apron, secretly she\\nliked to have them crowding through her kitchen.\\n\\nNow if you, reader--for I assume you to be one of the gathering\\naudience--were of the kind careful on scrubbing days to scrape your feet\\nupon the iron outside and to cross the kitchen on the unwashed parts, then\\nit is likely that you stood in the good graces of the cook. Mark your\\nreward! As you journeyed upward, you munched upon a cookie and bit scallops\\nin its edge. Or if a ravenous haste was in you--as commonly comes up in the\\nmiddle afternoon--you waived this slower method and crammed yourself with\\na recklessness that bestrewed the purlieus of your mouth. If your ears lay\\nbeyond the muss, the stowage was deemed decent and in order.\\n\\nIs there not a story in which children are tracked by an ogre through the\\nperilous wood by the crumbs they dropped? Then let us hope there is no ogre\\nlurking on these back stairs, for the trail is plain. It would be near the\\ntop, farthest from the friendly kitchen, that the attack might come, for\\nthere the stairs yielded to the darkness of the attic. There it was best\\nto look sharp and to turn the corners wide. A brave whistling kept out the\\nother noises.\\n\\nIt was after Aladdin had been in town that the fires burned hottest in us.\\nMy grandfather and I went together to the matinee, his great thumb within\\nmy fist. We were frequent companions. Together we had sat on benches in the\\npark and poked the gravel into patterns. We went to Dime Museums. Although\\nhis eyes had looked longer on the world than mine, we seemed of an equal\\nage.\\n\\nThe theatre was empty as we entered. We carried a bag of candy against a\\nsudden appetite--colt's foot, a penny to the stick. Here and there ushers\\nwere clapping down the seats, sounds to my fancy not unlike the first corn\\nwithin a popper. Somewhere aloft there must have been a roof, else the day\\nwould have spied in on us, yet it was lost in the gloom. It was as though\\na thrifty owner had borrowed the dusky fabrics of the night to make his\\ncover. The curtain was indistinct, but we knew it to be the Stratford\\nChurch and we dimly saw its spire.\\n\\nNow, on the opening of a door to the upper gallery, there was a scampering\\nto get seats in front, speed being whetted by a long half hour of waiting\\non the stairs. Ghostly, unbodied heads, like the luminous souls of lost\\nmountaineers--for this was the kind of fiction, got out of the Public\\nLibrary, that had come last beneath my thumb--ghostly heads looked down\\nupon us across the gallery rail.\\n\\nAnd now, if you will tip back your head like a paper-hanger--whose Adam's\\napple would seem to attest a life of sidereal contemplation--you will see\\nin the center of the murk above you a single point of light. It is the\\nspark that will ignite the great gas chandelier. I strain my neck to the\\npoint of breaking. My grandfather strains his too, for it is a game between\\nus which shall announce the first spurting of the light. At last! We cry\\nout together. The spark catches the vent next to it. It runs around the\\ncircle of glass pendants. The whole blazes up. The mountaineers come to\\nlife. They lean forward on their elbows.\\n\\nFrom the wings comes the tuning of the violins. A flute ripples up and down\\nin a care-free manner as though the villain Kazrac were already dead and\\nvirtue had come into its own. The orchestra emerges from below. Their\\ncalmness is but a pretense. Having looked on such sights as lie behind the\\ncurtain, having trod such ways, they should be bubbling with excitement.\\nYet observe the bass viol! How sodden is his eye! How sunken is his gaze!\\nWith what dull routine he draws his bow, as though he knew naught but\\nsleepy tunes! If there be any genie in the place, as the program says, let\\nhim first stir this sad fellow from his melancholy!\\n\\nWe consult our programs. The first scene is the magician's cave where he\\nplans his evil schemes. The second is the Chinese city where he pretends to\\nbe Aladdin's uncle. And for myself, did a friendly old gentleman offer me\\nlollypops and all-day-suckers--for so did the glittering baubles present\\nthemselves across the footlights--like Aladdin I, too, would not have\\nsquinted too closely on his claim. Gladly I would have gone off with him on\\nan all-day picnic toward the Chinese mountains.\\n\\nWe see a lonely pass in the hills, the cave of jewels (splendid to the eye\\nof childhood) where the slave of the lamp first appears, and finally the\\nthrone-room with Aladdin seated safely beside his princess.\\n\\nWho knows how to dip a pen within the twilight? Who shall trace the figures\\nof the mist? The play is done. We come out in silence. Our candy is but a\\nremnant. Darkness has fallen. The pavements are wet and shining, so that\\nthe night might see his face, if by chance the old fellow looked our way.\\n\\nAll about there are persons hurrying home with dinner-pails, who, by their\\ndull eyes, seem never to have heard what wonders follow on the rubbing of a\\nlamp.\\n\\nBut how the fires leaped up--how ambition beat within us--how our attic\\ntheatre was wrought to perfection--how the play came off and wracked the\\nneighborhood of its pins--with what grace I myself acted Aladdin--these\\nthings must be written by a vain and braggart pen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Pepys Sits in the Pit\\n\\n\\nWhen it happens that a man has risen to be a member of Parliament, the\\nSecretary of the British Navy and the President of the Royal Society, when\\nhe has become the adviser of the King and is moreover the one really bright\\nspot in that King's reign, it is amazing that considerably more than one\\nhundred years after his death, when the navy that he nurtured dominates the\\nseven seas, that he himself on a sudden should be known, not for his larger\\naccomplishments, but as a kind of tavern crony and pot-companion. When he\\nshould be standing with fame secure in a solemn though dusty niche in the\\nTemple of Time, it is amazing that he should be remembered chiefly for\\ncertain quarrels with his wife and as a frequenter of plays and summer\\ngardens.\\n\\nYet this is the fate of Samuel Pepys. Before the return of the Stuarts he\\nheld a poor clerkship in the Navy Office and cut his quill obscurely at\\nthe common desk. At the Restoration, partly by the boost of influence, but\\nchiefly by his substantial merit, he mounted to several successively higher\\nposts. The Prince of Wales became his friend and patron and when he became\\nLord High Admiral he took Pepys with him in his advancement. Thus in 1684,\\nPepys became Secretary of the Navy. When later the Prince of Wales became\\nKing James II, Pepys, although his office remained the same, came to quite\\na pinnacle of administrative power. He was shrewd and capable in the\\nconduct of his position and brought method to the Navy Office. He was a\\nprime factor in the first development of the British Navy. Later victories\\nthat were to sweep the seas may be traced in part to him. Nelson rides upon\\nhis shoulders. These achievements should have made his fame secure. But\\non a sudden he gained for posterity a less dignified although a more\\ninteresting and enduring renown.\\n\\nIn life, Samuel Pepys walked gravely in majestical robe with full-bottomed\\nwig and with ceremonial lace flapping at his wrists. Every step, if his\\nportrait is to be believed, was a bit of pageantry. Such was his fame, that\\nif his sword but clacked a warning on the pavement, it must have brought\\nthe apprentices to the windows. Tradesmen laid down their wares to get a\\nlook at him. Fat men puffed and strained to gain the advantage of a sill.\\nFashionable ladies peeped from brocaded curtains and ogled for his regard.\\nOr if he went by chair, the carriers held their noses up as though offended\\nby the common air. When he spoke before the Commons, the galleries were\\nhushed. He gave his days to the signing of stiff parchments--Admiralty\\nOrders or what not. He checked the King himself at the council table. In\\nshort, he was not only a great personage, but also he was quite well aware\\nof the fact and held himself accordingly.\\n\\nBut now many years have passed, and Time, that has so long been at bowls\\nwith reputations, has acquired a moderate skill in knocking them down. Let\\nus see how it fares with Pepys! Some men who have been roguish in their\\nlives have been remembered by their higher accomplishments. A string\\nof sonnets or a novel or two, if it catches the fancy, has wiped out a\\ntap-room record. The winning of a battle has obliterated a meanly spent\\nyouth. It is true that for a while an old housewife who once lived on the\\nhero's street will shake a dubious finger on his early pranks. Stolen\\napples or cigarettes behind the barn cram her recollection. But even a\\nvillage reputation fades. In time the sonnets and glorious battle have the\\nupper place. But things went the other way with Pepys. Rather, his fate\\nis like that of Zeus, who--if legend is to be trusted--was in his life a\\nperson of some importance whose nod stirred society on Olympus, but who is\\nnow remembered largely for his flirtations and his braggart conduct. A not\\nunlike evil has fallen on the magnificent Mr. Pepys.\\n\\nThis fate came to him because--as the world knows--it happened that for\\na period of ten years in comparative youth, he wrote an interesting and\\nhonest diary. He began this diary in 1659, while he was still a poor clerk\\nliving with his wife in a garret, and ended it in 1669, when, although he\\nhad emerged from obscurity, his greater honors had not yet been set on him.\\nAll the facts of his life during this period are put down, whether good or\\nbad, small or large, generous or mean. He writes of his mornings spent in\\nwork at his office, of his consultations with higher officials. There\\nis much running to and fro of business. The Dutch war bulks to a proper\\nlength. Parliament sits through a page at a stretch. Pepys goes upon the\\nstreets in the days of the plague and writes the horror of it--the houses\\nmarked with red crosses and with prayers scratched beneath--the stench and\\nthe carrying of dead bodies. He sees the great fire of London from his\\nwindow on the night it starts; afterwards St. Paul's with its roofs fallen.\\nHe is on the fleet that brings Charles home from his long travels, and\\nafterwards when Charles is crowned, he records the processions and the\\ncrowds. But also Pepys quarrels with his wife and writes it out on paper.\\nHe debauches a servant and makes a note of it. He describes a supper at an\\nale-house, and how he plays on the flute. He sings \\\"Beauty Retire,\\\" a song\\nof his own making, and tells how his listeners \\\"cried it up.\\\"\\n\\nIn consequence of this, Samuel Pepys is now known chiefly for his\\nattentions to the pretty actresses of Drury Lane, for kissing Nell Gwynne\\nin her tiring-room, for his suppers with \\\"the jade\\\" Mrs. Knipp, for his\\nlove of a tune upon the fiddle, for coming home from Vauxhall by wherry\\nlate at night, \\\"singing merrily\\\" down the river. Or perhaps we recall him\\nbest for burying his wine and Parmazan cheese in his garden at the time\\nof the Fire, or for standing to the measure of Mr. Pin the tailor for a\\n\\\"camlett cloak with gold buttons,\\\" or for sitting for his portrait in an\\nIndian gown which he \\\"hired to be drawn in.\\\" Who shall say that this is not\\nthe very portrait by which we have fancied him stalking off to Commons?\\nCould the apprentices have known in what a borrowed majesty he walked,\\nwould they not have tossed their caps in mirth and pointed their dusky\\nfingers at him?\\n\\nOr we remember that he once lived in a garret, and that his wife, \\\"poor\\nwretch,\\\" was used to make the fire while Samuel lay abed, and that she\\nwashed his \\\"foul clothes\\\"--that by degrees he came to be wealthy and\\nrode in his own yellow coach--that his wife went abroad in society \\\"in\\na flowered tabby gown\\\"--that Pepys forsook his habits of poverty and\\nexchanged his twelve-penny seat in the theatre gallery for a place in the\\npit--and that on a rare occasion (doubtless when he was alone and there was\\nbut one seat to buy) he arose to the extravagance of a four-shilling box.\\n\\nConsequently, despite the weightier parts of the diary, we know Pepys\\nchiefly in his hours of ease. Sittings and consultations are so dry. If\\nonly the world would run itself decently and in silence! Even a meeting of\\nthe Committee for Tangier--when the Prince of Wales was present and such\\nsmaller fry as Chancellors--is dull and is matter for a skipping eye.\\n\\nIf a session of Parliament bulks to a fat paragraph and it happens that\\nthere is a bit of deviltry just below at the bottom of the page--maybe no\\nmore than a clinking of glasses (or perhaps Nell Gwynne's name pops in\\nsight)--bless us how the eye will hurry to turn the leaf on the chance\\nof roguery to come! Who would read through a long discourse on Admiralty\\nbusiness, if it be known before that Pepys is engaged with the pretty Mrs.\\nKnipp for a trip to Bartholomew Fair to view the dancing horse, and that\\nthe start is to be made on the turning of the page? Or a piece of scandal\\nabout Lady Castlemaine, how her nose fell out of joint when Mrs. Stuart\\ncame to court--such things tease one from the sterner business.\\n\\nAnd for these reasons, we have been inclined to underestimate the\\nimportance of Pepys' diary. Francis Jeffrey, who wrote long ago about\\nPepys, evidently thought that he was an idle and unprofitable fellow and\\nthat the diary was too much given to mean and petty things. But in reality\\nthe diary is an historical mine. Even when Pepys plays upon the surface,\\nhe throws out facts that can be had nowhere else. No one would venture to\\nwrite of Restoration life without digging through his pages. Pepys wrote in\\na confused shorthand, maybe against the eye of his wife, from whom he had\\nreason to conceal his offenses. The papers lay undeciphered until 1825,\\nwhen a partial publication was made. There were additions by subsequent\\neditors until now it appears that the Wheatley text of 1893-1899 is final.\\nBut ever since 1825, the diary has been judged to be of high importance in\\nthe understanding of the first decade of the Restoration.\\n\\nIf some of the weightier parts are somewhat dry, there are places in which\\na lighter show of personality is coincident with real historical data.\\nForemost are the pages where Pepys goes to the theatre.\\n\\nMore than Charles II was restored in 1660. Among many things of more\\nimportance than this worthless King, the theatre was restored. Since the\\nclose of Elizabethan times it had been out of business. More than thirty\\nyears before, Puritanism had snuffed out its candles and driven its\\nfiddlers to the streets. But Puritanism, in its turn, fell with the return\\nof the Stuarts. Pepys is a chief witness as to what kind of theatre it was\\nthat was set up in London about the year 1660. It was far different from\\nthe Elizabethan theatre. It came in from the Bankside and the fields to the\\nnorth of the city and lodged itself on the better streets and squares. It\\nno longer patterned itself on the inn-yard, but was roofed against the\\nrain. The time had been when the theatre was cousin to the bear-pit. They\\nwere ranged together on the Bankside and they sweat and smelled like\\ncongenial neighbors. But these days are past. Let Bartholomew Fair be as\\nrowdy as it pleases, let acrobats and such loose fellows keep to Southwark,\\nthe theatre has risen in the world! It has put on a wig, as it were, it has\\ntied a ribbon to itself and has become fashionable. And although it has\\ntaken on a few extra dissolute habits, they are of the genteelest kind and\\nwill make it feel at home in the upper circles.\\n\\nBut also the theatre introduced movable scenery. There is an attempt toward\\nelaboration of stage effect. \\\"To the King's playhouse--\\\" says Pepys, \\\"a\\ngood scene of a town on fire.\\\" Women take parts. An avalanche of new plays\\ndescends on it. Even the old plays that have survived are garbled to suit a\\nchange of taste.\\n\\nBut if you would really know what kind of theatre it was that sprang up\\nwith the Stuarts and what the audiences looked like and how they behaved,\\nyou must read Pepys. With but a moderate use of fancy, you can set out with\\nhim in his yellow coach for the King's house in Drury Lane. Perhaps hunger\\nnips you at the start. If so, you stop, as Pepys pleasantly puts it, for a\\n\\\"barrel of oysters.\\\" Then, having dusted yourself of crumbs, you take the\\nroad again. Presently you come to Drury Lane. Other yellow coaches are\\nbefore you. There is a show of foppery on the curb and an odor of smoking\\nlinks. A powdered beauty minces to the door. Once past the doorkeeper, you\\nhear the cries of the orange women going up and down the aisles. There is a\\nshuffling of apprentices in the gallery. A dandy who lolls in a box with a\\nsilken leg across the rail, scrawls a message to an actress and sends it\\noff by Orange Moll. Presently Castlemaine enters the royal box with the\\nKing. There is a craning of necks, for with her the King openly \\\"do\\ndiscover a great deal of familiarity.\\\" In other boxes are other fine ladies\\nwearing vizards to hold their modesty if the comedy is free. A board breaks\\nin the ceiling of the gallery and dust falls in the men's hair and the\\nladies' necks, which, writes Pepys, \\\"made good sport.\\\" Or again, \\\"A\\ngentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in\\nthe midst of the play, did drop down as dead; being choked, but with much\\nado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat and brought him to\\nlife again.\\\" Or perhaps, \\\"I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit\\nbackward upon me by a mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a\\nvery pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.\\\"\\n\\nAt a change of scenes, Mrs. Knipp spies Pepys and comes to the pit door. He\\ngoes with her to the tiring-room. \\\"To the women's shift,\\\" he writes,\\n\\\"where Nell was dressing herself, and was all unready, and is very pretty,\\nprettier than I thought.... But to see how Nell cursed for having so few\\npeople in the pit, was pretty.\\\"--\\\"But Lord! their confidence! and how\\nmany men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how\\nconfident they are in their talk!\\\" Or he is whispered a bit of gossip, how\\nCastlemaine is much in love with Hart, an actor of the house. Then Pepys\\ngoes back into the pit and lays out a sixpence for an orange. As the play\\nnears its end, footmen crowd forward at the doors. The epilogue is spoken.\\nThe fiddles squeak their last. There is a bawling outside for coaches.\\n\\n\\\"Would it fit your humor,\\\" asks Mr. Pepys, when we have been handed to our\\nseats, \\\"would it fit your humor, if we go around to the Rose Tavern for\\nsome burnt wine and a breast of mutton off the spit? It's sure that some\\nbrave company will fall in, and we can have a tune. We'll not heed the\\nbellman. We'll sit late, for it will be a fine light moonshine morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo an Unknown Reader\\n\\n\\nOnce in a while I dream that I come upon a person who is reading a book\\nthat I have written. In my pleasant dreams these persons do not nod\\nsleepily upon my pages, and sometimes I fall in talk with them. Although\\nthey do not know who I am, they praise the book and name me warmly among\\nmy betters. In such circumstance my happy nightmare mounts until I ride\\nforemost with the giants. If I could think that this disturbance of my\\nsleep came from my diet and that these agreeable persons arose from a\\nlobster or a pie, nightly at supper I would ply my fork recklessly among\\nthe platters.\\n\\nBut in a waking state these meetings never come. If an article of mine is\\never read at all, it is read in secret like the Bible. Once, indeed, in a\\nfriend's house I saw my book upon the table, but I suspect that it had been\\ndusted and laid out for my coming. I request my hostess that next time, for\\nmy vanity, she lay the book face down upon a chair, as though the grocer's\\nknock intruded. Or perhaps a huckster's cart broke upon her enjoyment.\\nLet it be thought that a rare bargain--tender asparagus or the first\\nstrawberries of the summer--tempted her off my pages! Or maybe there was\\nred rhubarb in the cart and the jolly farmer, as he journeyed up the\\nstreet, pitched it to a pleasing melody. Dear lady, I forgive you. But let\\nus hope no laundryman led you off! Such discord would have marred my book.\\n\\nI saw once in a public library, as I went along the shelves, a volume of\\nmine which gave evidence to have been really read. The record in front\\nshowed that it had been withdrawn one time only. The card was blank\\nbelow--but once certainly it had been read. I hope that the book went out\\non a Saturday noon when the spirits rise for the holiday to come, and that\\na rainy Sunday followed, so that my single reader was kept before his fire.\\nA dull patter on the window--if one sits unbuttoned on the hearth--gives\\na zest to a languid chapter. The rattle of a storm--if only the room be\\nsnug--fixes the attention fast. Therefore, let the rain descend as though\\nthe heavens rehearsed for a flood! Let a tempest come out of the west! Let\\nthe chimney roar as it were a lion! And if there must be a clearing, let\\nit hold off until the late afternoon, lest it sow too early a distaste for\\nindoors and reading! There is scarcely a bookworm who will not slip his\\nglasses off his nose, if the clouds break at the hour of sunset when the\\nearth and sky are filled with a green and golden light. I took the book off\\nthe library shelf and timidly glancing across my shoulder for fear that\\nsome one might catch me, I looked along the pages. There was a thumb mark\\nin a margin, and presently appeared a kindly stickiness on the paper as\\nthough an orange had squirted on it. Surely there had been a human being\\nhereabouts. It was as certain as when Crusoe found the footprints in the\\nsand. Ah, I thought, this fellow who sits in the firelight has caught an\\nappetite. Perhaps he bit a hole and sucked the fruit, and the skin has\\nburst behind. Or I wave the theory and now conceive that the volume was\\nread at breakfast. If so, it is my comfort that in those dim hours it stood\\npropped against his coffee cup.\\n\\nBut the trail ended with the turning of the page. There were, indeed,\\nfurther on, pencil checks against one of the paragraphs as if here the book\\nhad raised a faint excitement, but I could not tell whether they sprang\\nup in derision or in approval. Toward the end there were uncut leaves, as\\nthough even my single reader had failed in his persistence.\\n\\nBeing swept once beyond a usual caution, I lamented to my friend F---- of\\nthe neglect in which readers held me, to which the above experience in\\na library was a rare exception. F---- offered me such consolation as he\\ncould, deplored the general taste and the decadence of the times, and said\\nthat as praise was sweet to everyone, he, as far as he himself was able,\\noffered it anonymously to those who merited it. He was standing recently\\nin a picture gallery, when a long-haired man who stood before one of the\\npictures was pointed out to him as the artist who had painted it. At once\\nF---- saw his opportunity to confer a pleasure, but as there is a touch of\\nhumor in him, he first played off a jest. Lounging forward, he dropped his\\nhead to one side as artistic folk do when they look at color. He made a\\nknot-hole of his fingers and squinted through. Next he retreated across the\\nroom and stood with his legs apart in the very attitude of wisdom. He cast\\na stern eye upon the picture and gravely tapped his chin. At last when the\\nartist was fretted to an extremity, F---- came forward and so cordially\\npraised the picture that the artist, being now warmed and comforted,\\npresently excused himself in a high excitement and rushed away to start\\nanother picture while the pleasant spell was on him.\\n\\nHad I been the artist, I would have run from either F----'s praise or\\ndisapproval. As an instance, I saw a friend on a late occasion coming from\\na bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath his arm. I had been\\navoiding that particular bookstore for a week because my book lay for sale\\non a forward table. And now when my friend appeared, a sudden panic seized\\nme and I plunged into the first doorway to escape. I found myself facing a\\nsoda fountain. For a moment, in my blur, I could not account for the\\nsoda fountain, or know quite how it had come into my life. Presently an\\ninterne--for he was jacketted as if he walked a hospital--asked me what I'd\\nhave.\\n\\nStill somewhat dazed, in my discomposure, having no answer ready, my\\nstartled fancy ran among the signs and labels of the counter until I\\nrecalled that a bearded man once, unblushing in my presence, had ordered\\na banana flip. I got the fellow's ear and named it softly. Whereupon he\\nplaced a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice-cream, poured on colored\\njuices as though to mark the fatal wound and offered it to me. I ate a few\\nbites of the sickish mixture until the streets were safe.\\n\\nI do not know to what I can attribute my timidity. Possibly it arises from\\nthe fact that until recently my writing met with uniform rejection and\\nfailure. For years I wrote secretly in order that few persons might know\\nhow miserably I failed. I answered upon a question that I had given up the\\npractice, that I now had no time for it, that I scribbled now and then\\nbut always burned it. All that while I gave my rare leisure and my stolen\\nafternoons--the hours that other men give to golf and sleep and sitting\\ntogether--these hours I gave to writing. On a holiday I was at it early. On\\nSaturday when other folks were abroad, I sat at my desk. It was my grief\\nthat I was so poor a borrower of the night that I blinked stupidly on my\\npapers if I sat beyond the usual hour. Writing was my obsession. I need no\\npity for my failures, for although I tossed my cap upon a rare acceptance,\\nmy deeper joy was in the writing. That joy repeated failures could not\\nblunt.\\n\\nThere are paragraphs that now lie yellow in my desk with their former\\nmeaning faded, that still recall as I think of them the first exaltation\\nwhen I wrote them--feverishly in a hot emotion. In those days I thought\\nthat I had caught the sunlight on my pen, and the wind and the moon and the\\nspinning earth. I thought that the valleys and the mountains arose from the\\nmist obedient to me. If I splashed my pen, in my warm regard it was the\\nroar and fury of the sea. It was really no more than my youth crying out.\\nAnd, alas, my thoughts and my feelings escaped me when I tried to put them\\ndown on paper, although I did not know it then. Perhaps they were too\\nvagrant to be held. And yet these paragraphs that might be mournful records\\nof failure, fill me with no more than a tender recollection for the boy\\nwho wrote them. The worn phrases now beg their way with broken steps. Like\\nshrill and piping minstrels they whine and crack a melody that I still\\nremember in its freshness.\\n\\nBut perhaps, reader, we are brothers in these regards. Perhaps you, too,\\nhave faded papers. Or possibly, even on a recent date, you sighed your soul\\ninto an essay or a sonnet, and you now have manuscript which you would like\\nto sell. Do not mistake me! I am not an editor, nor am I an agent for these\\nwares. Rather I speak as a friend who, having many such hidden sorrows,\\noffers you a word of comfort. To a desponding Hamlet I exclaim, \\\"'Tis\\ncommon, my Lord.\\\" I have so many friends that have had an unproductive\\nfling toward letters, that I think the malady is general. So many books are\\npublished and flourish a little while in their bright wrappers, but yours\\nand theirs and mine waste away in a single precious copy.\\n\\nI am convinced that a close inspection of all desks--a federal matter as\\nthough Capital were under fire--would betray thousands of abandoned novels.\\nThere may be a few stern desks that are so cluttered with price-sheets and\\nstock-lists that they cannot offer harborage to a love tale. Standing desks\\nin particular, such as bookkeepers affect, are not always chinked\\nwith these softer plots. And rarely there is a desk so smothered in\\nlearning--reeking so of scholarship--as not to admit a lighter nook for\\nthe tucking of a sea yarn. Even so, it was whispered to me lately that\\nProfessor B----, whose word shakes the continent, holds in a lower drawer\\nno fewer than three unpublished historical novels, each set up with a full\\nquota of smugglers and red bandits. One of these stories deals scandalously\\nwith the abduction of an heiress, but this must be held in confidence. The\\nprofessor is a stoic before his class, but there's blood in the fellow.\\n\\nThere is, therefore, little use in your own denial. You will recall that\\nonce, when taken to a ruined castle, you brooded on the dungeons until a\\nplot popped into your head. You crammed it with quaint phrasing from the\\nchroniclers. You stuffed it with soldiers' oaths. \\\"What ho! landlord,\\\"\\nyou wrote gayly at midnight, \\\"a foaming cup, good sir. God pity the poor\\nsailors that take the sea this night!\\\" And on you pelted with your plot to\\nsuch conflicts and hair-breadth escapes as lay in your contrivance.\\n\\nThese things you have committed. Good sir, we are of a common piece. Let us\\nsalute as brothers! And therefore, as to a comrade, I bid you continue in\\nyour ways. And that you may not lack matter for your pen, I warmly urge\\nyou, when by shrewdest computation you have exhausted the plots of\\nadventure and have worn your villains thin, that you proceed in quieter\\nvein. I urge you to an April mood, for the winds of Spring are up and\\ndaffodils nod across the garden. There is black earth in the Spring and\\ngreen hilltops, and there is also the breath of flowers along the fences\\nand the sound of water for your pen to prattle of.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Plague of All Cowards\\n\\n\\nHaving written lately against the dog, several acquaintances have asked me\\nto turn upon the cat, and they have been good enough to furnish me with\\ninstances of her faithlessness. Also, a lady with whom I recently sat at\\ndinner, inquired of me on the passing of the fish, whether I had ever\\nproperly considered the cow, which she esteemed a most mischievous animal.\\nOne of them had mooed at her as she crossed a pasture and she had hastily\\nclimbed a fence. I get a good many suggestions first and last. I was once\\ntaken to a Turkish bath for no other reason--as I was afterwards told--than\\nthat it might supply me with a topic. Odd books have been put in my way.\\nA basket of school readers was once lodged with me, with a request that I\\ndirect my attention to the absurd selection of the poems. I have been urged\\nto go against car conductors and customs men. On one occasion I received a\\npaper of tombstone inscriptions, with a note of direction how others might\\nbe found in a neighboring churchyard if I were curious. A lady in whose\\ncompany I camped last summer has asked me to give a chapter to it. We were\\nabroad upon a lake in the full moon--we were lost upon a mountain--twice a\\ncanoe upset--there were the usual jests about cooking. These things might\\nhave filled a few pages agreeably, yet so far they have given me only a\\nparagraph.\\n\\nBut I am not disposed toward any of these subjects, least of all the cat,\\nupon which I look--despite the coldness of her nature--as a harmless and\\ncomforting appendage of the hearth-rug. I would no more prey upon her\\nmorals than I would the morals of the andirons. I choose, rather, to slip\\nto another angle of the question and say a few words about cowards, among\\nwhom I have already confessed that I number myself.\\n\\nIn this year of battles, when physical courage sits so high, the reader--if\\nhe is swept off in the general opinion--will expect under such a title\\nsomething caustic. He will think that I am about to loose against all\\ncowards a plague of frogs and locusts as if old Egypt had come again. But\\ncowardice is its own punishment. It needs no frog to nip it. Even the\\nsharp-toothed locust--for in the days that bordered so close upon the\\nmastodon, the locust could hardly have fallen to the tender greenling we\\nknow today--even the locust that once spoiled the Egyptians could not now\\nadd to the grief of a coward.\\n\\nAnd yet--really I hesitate. I blush. My attack will be too intimate; for I\\nhave confessed that I am not the very button on the cap of bravery. I have\\nindeed stiffened myself to ride a horse, a mightier feat than driving him\\nbecause of the tallness of the monster and his uneasy movement, as though\\nhis legs were not well socketed and might fall out on a change of gaits. I\\nhave ridden on a camel in a side-show, but have found my only comfort in\\nhis hump. I have stroked the elephant. In a solemn hour of night I have\\ngone downstairs to face a burglar. But I do not run singing to these\\ndangers. While your really brave fellow is climbing a dizzy staircase to\\nthe moon--I write in figure--I would shake with fear upon a lower platform.\\n\\nPerhaps you recall Mr. Tipp of the Elia essays. \\\"Tipp,\\\" says his pleasant\\nbiographer, \\\"never mounted the box of a stage-coach in his life; or leaned\\nagainst the rails of a balcony; or walked upon the ridge of a parapet; or\\nlooked down a precipice; or let off a gun.\\\" I cannot follow Tipp, it may\\nbe, to his extreme tremors--my hair will not rise to so close a likeness of\\nthe fretful porcupine--yet in a measure we are in agreement. We are, as it\\nwere, cousins, with the mark of our common family strong on both of us.\\n\\nThere are persons who, when in your company on a country walk, will steal\\napples, not with a decent caution from a tree along the fence, but far\\nafield. If there are grapes, they will not wait for a turn of the road,\\nbut will pluck them in the open. Or maybe in your wandering you come on a\\nhalf-built house. You climb in through a window to look about. Here the\\nstairs will go. The ice-box will be set against this wall. But if your\\ncompanion is one of valor's minions, he will not be satisfied with this\\nsafe and agreeable research--this mild speculation on bath-rooms--this\\ninnocent placing of a stove. He must go aloft. He has seen a ladder and\\nyearns to climb it. The footing on the second story is bad enough. If you\\nfall between the joists, you will clatter to the basement. It is hard to\\nrealize that such an open breezy place will ever be cosy and warm with\\nfires, and that sleepy folk will here lie snugly a-bed on frosty mornings.\\nBut still the brazen fellow is not content. A ladder leads horribly to the\\nroof. For myself I will climb until the tip of my nose juts out upon the\\nworld--until it sprouts forth to the air from the topmost timbers: But I\\nwill go no farther. But if your companion sees a scaffold around a chimney,\\nhe must perch on it. For him, a dizzy plank is a pleasant belvedere from\\nwhich to view the world.\\n\\nThe bravery of this kind of person is not confined to these few matters.\\nIf you happen to go driving with him, he will--if the horse is of the kind\\nthat distends his nostrils--on a sudden toss you the reins and leave you to\\nguard him while he dispatches an errand. If it were a motor car there would\\nbe a brake to hold it. If it were a boat, you might throw out an anchor. A\\nbutcher's cart would have a metal drag. But here you sit defenseless--tied\\nto the whim of a horse--greased for a runaway. The beast Dobbin turns his\\nhead and holds you with his hard eye. There is a convulsive movement along\\nhis back, a preface, it may be, to a sudden seizure. A real friend would\\nhave loosed the straps that run along the horse's flanks. Then, if any\\ndeviltry take him, he might go off alone and have it out.\\n\\nI have in mind a livery stable in Kalamazoo. Myself and another man of\\nequal equestrianism were sent once to bring out a thing called a surrey and\\na pair of horses. Do you happen to be acquainted with Blat's Horse Food? If\\nyour way lies among the smaller towns, you must know its merits. They are\\nproclaimed along the fences and up the telegraph poles. Drinking-troughs\\nspeak its virtues. Horses thrive on Blat's Food. They neigh for it. A\\nflashing lithograph is set by way of testament wherever traffic turns or\\nlingers. Do you not recall the picture? A great red horse rears himself\\non his hind legs. His forward hoofs are extended. He is about to trample\\nsomeone under foot. His nostrils are wide. He is unduly excited. It cannot\\nbe food, it must be drink that stirs him. He is a fearful spectacle.\\n\\nThere was such a picture on the wall of the stable.\\n\\n\\\"Have you any horses,\\\" I asked nervously, jerking my thumb toward the wall,\\n\\\"any horses that have been fed on just ordinary food? Some that are a\\nlittle tired?\\\"\\n\\nFor I remembered how Mr. Winkle once engaged horses to take the\\nPickwickians out to Manor Farm and what mishaps befell them on the way.\\n\\n\\\"'He don't shy, does he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\\n\\n\\\"'Shy, sir?--He wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vagginload of monkeys with\\ntheir tails burnt off.'\\\"\\n\\nBut how Mr. Pickwick dropped his whip, how Mr. Winkle got off his tall\\nhorse to pick it up, how he tried in vain to remount while his horse went\\nround and round, how they were all spilt out upon the bridge and how\\nfinally they walked to Manor Farm--these things are known to everybody with\\nan inch of reading.\\n\\n\\\"'How far is it to Dingley Dell?' they asked.\\n\\n\\\"'Better er seven mile.'\\n\\n\\\"'Is it a good road?'\\n\\n\\\"'No, t'ant.'...\\n\\n\\\"The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall quadruped,\\nfor which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust, following slowly at\\ntheir heels.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you any horses,\\\" I repeated, \\\"that have not been fed on Blat's\\nFood--horses that are, so to speak, on a diet?\\\"\\n\\nIn the farthest stalls, hidden from the sunlight and the invigorating\\ninfection of the day, two beasts were found with sunken chests and hollow\\neyes, who took us safely to our destination on their hands and knees.\\n\\nAs you may suspect, I do not enjoy riding. There is, it is true, one saddle\\nhorse in North Carolina that fears me. If time still spares him, that horse\\nI could ride with content. But I would rather trust myself on the top of a\\nwobbly step-ladder than up the sides of most horses. I am not quite of a\\nmind, however, with Samuel Richardson who owned a hobby-horse and rode on\\nhis hearth-rug in the intervals of writing \\\"Pamela.\\\" It is likely that when\\nhe had rescued her from an adventure of more than usual danger--perhaps her\\nvillainous master has been concealed in her closet--perhaps he has been\\nhiding beneath her bed--it is likely, having brought her safely off, the\\nauthor locked her in the buttery against a fresh attack. Then he felt, good\\nman, in need of exercise. So while he waits for tea and muffins, he leaps\\nupon his rocking-horse and prances off. As for the hobby-horse itself, I\\nhave not heard whether it was of the usual nursery type, or whether it was\\nbuilt in the likeness of the leather camels of a German steamship.\\n\\nI need hardly say that these confessions of my cowardice are for your ear\\nalone. They must not get abroad to smirch me. If on a country walk I have\\ntaken to my heels, you must not twit me with poltroonery. If you charge me\\nwith such faint-heartedness while other persons are present, I'll deny it\\nflat. When I sit in the company of ladies at dinner, I dissemble my true\\nnature, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat.\\nIf then, you taunt me, for want of a better escape, I shall turn it to a\\njest. I shall engage the table flippantly: Hear how preposterously the\\nfellow talks!--he jests to satisfy a grudge. In appearance I am whole as\\nthe marble, founded as a rock.\\n\\nBut really some of us cowards are diverting persons. The lady who directed\\nme against the cow is a most delightful woman with whom I hope I shall\\nagain sit at dinner. A witty lady of my acquaintance shivers when a\\ncat walks in the room. A man with whom I pass the time pleasantly and\\nprofitably, although he will not admit a fear of ghosts, still will not\\nsleep in an empty house because of possible noises. I would rather spend a\\nSaturday evening in the company of the cowardly Falstaff than of the bold\\nHotspur. If it were not for sack, villainous sack, and a few spots upon his\\nfront, you would go far to find a better companion than the fat old Knight.\\nBob Acres was not much for valor and he made an ass of himself when he went\\nto fight a duel, yet one could have sat agreeably at mutton with him.\\n\\nBut these things are slight. It matters little whether or not one can mount\\na ladder comfortably. Now that motors have come in, horses stand remotely\\nin our lives. Nor is it of great moment whether or not we fear to be out of\\nfashion--whether we halt in the wearing of a wrong-shaped hat, or glance\\nfearfully around when we choose from a line of forks. Superstitions rest\\nmostly on the surface and are not deadly in themselves. A man can be true\\nof heart even if he will not sit thirteen at table. But there is a kind\\nof fear that is disastrous to them that have it. It is the fear of the\\nmaterial universe in all its manifestations. There are persons, stout both\\nof chest and limb, who fear drafts and wet feet. A man who is an elephant\\nof valor and who has been feeling this long while a gentle contempt for\\nsuch as myself, will cry out if a soft breeze strikes against his neck. If\\na foot slips to the gutter and becomes wet, he will dose himself. Achilles\\ndid not more carefully nurse his heel. For him the lofty dome of air is\\npacked with malignant germs. The round world is bottled with contagion. A\\nstrong man who, in his time, might have slain the Sofi, is as fearful of\\nhis health as though the plague were up the street. Calamities beset him.\\nThe slightest sniffling in his nose is the trumpet for a deep disorder.\\nExistence is but a moving hazard. Life for him, poor fellow, is but a room\\nwith a window on the night and a storm beating on the casement. God knows,\\nit is better to grow giddy on a ladder than to think that this majestic\\nearth is such an universal pestilence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Asperities of the Early British Reviewers\\n\\n\\nBook reviewers nowadays direct their attention, for the most part, to the\\nworthy books and they habitually neglect those that seem beneath their\\nregard. On a rare occasion they assail an unprofitable book, but even this\\nis often but a bit of practice. They swish a bludgeon to try their hand.\\nThey only take their anger, as it were, upon an outing, lest with too\\nclose housing it grow pallid and shrink in girth. Or maybe they indulge\\nthemselves in humor. Perhaps they think that their pages grow dull and that\\nridicule will restore the balance. They throw it in like a drunken porter\\nto relieve a solemn scene. I fancy that editors of this baser sort keep on\\ntheir shelves one or two volumes for their readers' sport and mirth. I read\\nrecently a review of an historical romance--a last faltering descendant of\\nthe race--whose author in an endeavor to restore the past, had made too\\nfree a use of obsolete words. With what playfulness was he held up to\\nscorn! Mary come up, sweet chuck! How his quaint phrasing was turned\\nagainst him! What a merry fellow it is who writes, how sharp and caustic!\\nThere's pepper on his mood.\\n\\nBut generally, it is said, book reviews are too flattering. Professor\\nBliss Perry, being of this opinion, offered some time ago a statement\\nthat \\\"Magazine writing about current books is for the most part bland,\\ncomplaisant, pulpy.... The Pedagogue no longer gets a chance at the gifted\\nyoung rascal who needs, first and foremost, a premonitory whipping; the\\nyouthful genius simply stays away from school and carries his unwhipped\\ntalents into the market place.\\\" At a somewhat different angle of the same\\nopinion, Dr. Crothers suggests in an essay that instead of being directed\\nto the best books, we need to be warned from the worst. He proposes to set\\nup a list of the Hundred Worst Books. For is it not better, he asks, to put\\na lighthouse on a reef than in the channel? The open sea does not need a\\nbell-buoy to sound its depth.\\n\\nOn these hints I have read some of the book criticisms of days past to\\nlearn whether they too were pulpy--whether our present silken criticism\\nalways wore its gloves and perfumed itself, or whether it has fallen to\\nthis smiling senility from a sterner youth. Although I am usually a rusty\\nstudent, yet by diligence I have sought to mend my knowledge that I might\\nlay it out before you. Lately, therefore, if you had come within our Public\\nLibrary, you would have found me in one of these attempts. Here I went,\\nscrimping the other business of the day in order that I might be at my\\nstudies before the rush set in up town. Mine was the alcove farthest from\\nthe door, where are the mustier volumes that fit a bookish student. So if\\nyour quest was the lighter books--such verse and novels as present fame\\nattests--you did not find me. I was hooped and bowed around the corner. I\\nam no real scholar, but I study on a spurt. For a whole week together I may\\nread old plays until their jigging style infects my own. I have set myself\\nagainst the lofty histories, although I tire upon their lower slopes and\\nhave not yet persisted to their upper and windier ridges. I have, also, a\\npretty knowledge of the Queen Anne wits and feel that I must have dogged\\nand spied upon them while they were yet alive. But in general, although\\nI am curious in the earlier chapters of learning, I lag in the inner\\nwindings. However, for a fortnight I have sat piled about with old reviews,\\nwhose leather rots and smells, in order that I might study the fading\\ncriticisms of the past.\\n\\nUntil rather near the end of the eighteenth century, those who made their\\nliving in England by writing were chiefly publishers' hacks, fellows of\\nthe Dunciad sucking their quills in garrets and selling their labor for a\\ncrust, for the reading public was too small to support them. Or they\\nfound a patron and gave him a sugared sonnet for a pittance, or strained\\nthemselves to the length of an Ode for a berth in his household. Or\\nfrequently they supported a political party and received a place in the\\nRed Tape Office. But even in politics, on account of the smallness of the\\nreading public and the politicians' indifference to its approval, their\\nservices were of slight account. Too often a political office was granted\\nfrom a pocket borough in which a restricted electorate could be bought at a\\ntrifling expense. To gain support inside the House of Commons was enough.\\nThe greater public outside could be ignored. This attitude changed with\\nthe coming of the French Revolution. Here was a new force unrealized\\nbefore--that of a crowd which, being unrepresented and with a real\\ngrievance, could, when it liked, take a club and go after what it wanted.\\nFor the first time in many years in England--such were the whiffs of\\nliberty across the Channel--the power of an unrepresented public came to be\\nknown. It was not that the English crowd had as yet taken the club in its\\nhands, but there were new thoughts abroad in the world, and there was the\\npossibility to be regarded. To influence this larger public, therefore, men\\nwho could write came little by little into a larger demand. And as\\nwriters were comparatively scarce, all kinds--whether they wrote poems or\\nprose--were pressed into service. It is significant, too, that it was in\\nthe decades subjected to the first influence of the French Revolution that\\nthe English daily paper took its start as an agent to influence public\\nopinion.\\n\\nIt was therefore rather more than one hundred years ago that writers came\\nto a better prosperity. They came out of their garrets, took rooms on the\\nsecond floor, polished their brasses and became Persons. I can fancy that a\\nwriter after spending a morning in the composition of a political article\\non the whisper of a Cabinet Minister, wrote a sonnet after lunch, and\\na book review before dinner. Let us see in what mood they took their\\nadvancement! Let us examine their temper--but in book reviewing only, for\\nthat alone concerns us! In doing this, we have the advantage of knowing the\\nfinal estimate of the books they judged. Like the witch, we have looked\\ninto the seeds of time and we know \\\"which grain will grow and which will\\nnot.\\\"\\n\\nIn 1802, when the Edinburgh Review (which was the first of its line to\\nacquire distinction) came into being, the passion of the times found voice\\nin politics. Both Whigs and Tories had been alarmed by the excesses of the\\nFrench Revolution; both feared that England was drifting the way of France;\\neach had a remedy, but opposed and violently maintained. The Tories put the\\nblame of the Revolution on the compromises of Louis XVI, and accordingly\\nthey were hostile to any political change. The Whigs, on the other\\nhand, saw the rottenness of England as a cause that would incite her to\\nrevolution also, and they advocated reform while yet there was time. The\\ngeneral fear of a revolution gave the government of England to the Tories,\\nand kept them in power for several decades. And England was ripe for\\ntrouble. The government was but nominally representative. No Catholic,\\nJew, Dissenter or poor man had a vote or could hold a seat in Parliament.\\nIndustrially and economically the country was in the condition of France\\nin the year of Arthur Young's journey. The poverty was abject, the relief\\nfutile and the hatred of the poor for the rich was inflammatory.\\nGeorge III, slipping into feebleness and insanity, yet jealous of his\\nunconstitutional power, was a vacillating despot, quarrelling with his\\nCommons and his Ministers. Lord Eldon as Chancellor, but with as nearly the\\ncontrol of a Premier as the King would allow, was the staunch upholder of\\nall things that have since been disproved and discarded. Bagehot said of\\nhim that \\\"he believed in everything which it is impossible to believe in.\\\"\\nFrance and Napoleon threatened across the narrow channel. England still\\ngrowled at the loss of her American colonies. It was as yet the England\\nof the old regime. The great reforms were to come thirty years later--the\\nCatholic Emancipation, the abolishment of slavery in the colonies, the\\nsuppression of the pocket boroughs, the gross bribery of elections, the\\ncleaning of the poor laws and the courts of justice.\\n\\nIt was in this dark hour of English history that the writers polished their\\nbrasses and set up as Persons. And if the leading articles that they wrote\\nof mornings stung and snapped with venom, it is natural that the book\\nreviews on which they spent their afternoons had also some vinegar in them,\\nespecially if they concerned books written by those of the opposition. And\\nother writers, even if they had no political connection, borrowed their\\nmanners from those who had. It was the animosities of party politics that\\nset the general tone. Billingsgate that had grown along the wharves of the\\nlower river, was found to be of service in Parliament and gave a spice and\\nsparkle even to a book review. Presently a large part of literary England\\nwore the tags of political preference. Writers were often as clearly\\ndistinguished as were the ladies in the earlier day, when Addison wrote his\\npaper on party patches. There were seats of Moral Philosophy to be handed\\nout, under-secretaryships, consular appointments. It is not enough to say\\nthat Francis Jeffrey was a reviewer, he was as well a Whig and was running\\na Review that was Whig from the front cover to the back. Leigh Hunt was not\\nmerely a poet, for he was also a radical, and therefore in the opinions of\\nTories, a believer in immorality and indecency. No matter how innocent\\na title might appear, it was held in suspicion, on the chance that it\\nassailed the Ministry or endangered the purity of England. William Gifford\\nwas more than merely the editor of the Quarterly Review, for he was as well\\na Tory editor whose duty it was to pry into Whiggish roguery. Lockhart and\\nWilson, who wrote in Blackwood's, were Tories tooth and nail, biting and\\nscratching for party. Nowadays, literature, having found the public to be\\nits most profitable patron, works hard and even abjectly for its favor.\\nAlthough there are defects in the arrangement, it must be confessed that\\nthe divorce of literature from politics contributes to the general peace of\\nthe household.\\n\\nThe Edinburgh Review was founded in 1802, the Quarterly Review in 1809,\\nBlackwood's Magazine in 1817. These three won distinction among others of\\nless importance, and from them only I quote. In 1802, when Tory rule was\\nstrongest and Lord Eldon flourished, there was living in Edinburgh a group\\nof young men who were for the most part briefless barristers. Their case\\nwas worse because they were Whigs. Few cases came their way and no offices.\\nThese young men were Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner, Henry Brougham, and\\nthere was also Sydney Smith who had just come to Edinburgh from an English\\ncountry parish. The eldest was thirty-one, the youngest twenty-three.\\nAlthough all of them had brilliant lives before them, not one of them had\\nmade as yet more than a step toward his accomplishment. Sydney Smith had\\nbeen but lately an obscure curate, buried in the middle of Salisbury Plain,\\naway from all contact with the world. Francis Jeffrey had been a hack\\nwriter in London, had studied medicine, had sought unsuccessfully a\\ngovernment position in India, had written poor sonnets, and was now\\nlounging with but a scanty occupation in the halls of the law courts.\\nFrancis Horner had just come to the Scottish bar straight from his studies.\\nHenry Brougham, who in days to come was to be Lord Chancellor of England\\nand to whose skill in debate the passing of the Great Reform bill of 1832\\nis partly due, is also just admitted to the practice of the law.\\n\\nThe founding of the Review was casual. These men were accustomed to meet of\\nan evening for general discussion and speculation. It happened one night as\\nthey sat together--the place was a garret if legend is to be believed--that\\nSydney Smith lamented that their discussions came to nothing, for they were\\nall Whigs, all converted to the cause; whereas if they could only bring\\ntheir opinions to the outside public they could stir opinion. From so\\nslight a root the Review sprouted. Sydney Smith was made editor and kept\\nthe position until after the appearance of the first number, when Jeffrey\\nsucceeded him. The Review became immediately a power, appearing quarterly\\nand striking its blows anonymously against a sluggish government, lashing\\nthe Tory writers, and taking its part, which is of greater consequence, in\\nthe promulgation of the Whig reforms which were to ripen in thirty years\\nand convert the old into modern England. In the destruction of outworn\\nthings, it was, as it were, a magazine of Whig explosives.\\n\\nThe Quarterly Review was the next to come and it was Tory. John Murray, the\\nLondon publisher, had been the English distributor of the Edinburgh Review.\\nIn 1809, two considerations moved him to found in London a review to rival\\nthe Scotch periodical. First the Tory party was being hard hit by the\\nEdinburgh Review and there was need of defense and retaliation. In the\\nsecond place, John Murray saw that if his publishing house was to flourish,\\nit must provide this new form of literature that had become so popular.\\nFor the very shortness of the essays and articles, in which extensive\\nconditions were summarized for quick digestion, had met with English\\napproval as well as Scotch. People had become accustomed, says Bagehot, of\\ntaking \\\"their literature in morsels, as they take sandwiches on a journey.\\\"\\nMurray appealed to George Canning, then in office, for assistance and was\\nintroduced to William Gifford as a man capable of the undertaking, who\\nwould also meet the favor of the government party. The rise of the\\nQuarterly Review was not brilliant. It did not fill the craving for\\nnovelty, inasmuch as the Edinburgh was already in the field. Furthermore,\\nthere is not the opportunity in defense for as conspicuous gallantry as in\\noffensive warfare.\\n\\nIt was eight years before another enduring review was started. William\\nBlackwood of Edinburgh had grown like Murray from a bookseller to a\\npublisher, and he, too, looked for a means of increasing his prestige. He\\nhad launched a review the year previously, in 1816, but it had foundered\\nwhen it was scarcely off the ways. His second attempt he was determined\\nmust be successful. His new editors were John G. Lockhart and John Wilson,\\nand the new policy, although nominally Tory, was first and last the\\nmagazine's notoriety. It hawked its wares into public notice by sensational\\narticles and personal vilification. Wilson was thirty-two and Lockhart\\ntwenty-three, yet they were as mischievous as boys. In their pages is found\\nthe most abominable raving that has ever passed for literary criticism.\\nThey did not need any party hatred to fire them. William Blackwood\\nwelcomed any abuse that took his magazine out of \\\"the calm of respectable\\nmediocrity.\\\" Anything that stung or startled was welcome to a place in its\\npages.\\n\\nSo Blackwood's was published and Edinburgh city, we may be sure, set up a\\nroar of delight and anger. Never before had one's friends been so assailed.\\nNever before had one's enemies been so grilled. How pleasing for a Tory\\nfireside was the mud bath with which it defiled Coleridge, who was--and you\\nhad always known it--\\\"little better than a rogue.\\\" One's Tory dinner was\\nthe more toothsome for the hot abuse of the Chaldee Manuscript. What stout\\nTory, indeed, would doze of an evening on such a sheet! There followed\\nof course cases of libel. The editors even found it safer, after the\\npublication of the first number, to retire for a time to the country until\\nthe city cooled.\\n\\nI choose now to turn to the pages of these three reviews and set out before\\nyou samples of their criticisms, in order that you may contrast them\\nwith our own literary judgments. I warn you in fairness that I have been\\ndisposed to choose the worst, yet there are hundreds of other criticisms\\nbut little better. Of the three reviews, Blackwood's was the least\\nseriously political in its policy, yet its critical vilifications are the\\nworst. The Edinburgh Review, the most able of the three and the most in\\nearnest in politics, is the least vituperative. With this introduction, let\\nus shake the pepperpot and lay out the strong vinegar of our feast!\\n\\nIn the judgment of the Edinburgh Review, Tom Moore, who had just published\\nhis \\\"Odes and Epistles\\\" but had not yet begun his Irish melodies, is a man\\nwho \\\"with some brilliancy of fancy, and some show of classical erudition\\n... may boast, if the boast can please him, of being the most licentious of\\nmodern versifiers, and the most poetical of those who, in our times, have\\ndevoted their talents to the propagation of immorality. We regard his book,\\nindeed, as a public nuisance.... He sits down to ransact the impure places\\nof his memory for inflammatory images and expressions, and commits them\\nlaboriously in writing, for the purpose of insinuating pollution into the\\nminds of unknown and unsuspecting readers.\\\"\\n\\nFrancis Jeffrey wrote this, and Moore challenged him to fight. The police\\ninterfered, and as Jeffrey put it, \\\"the affair ended amicably. We have\\nsince breakfasted together very lovingly. He has expressed penitence for\\nwhat he has written and declared that he will never again apply any little\\ntalents he may possess to such purpose: and I have said that I shall be\\nhappy to praise him whenever I find that he has abjured these objectionable\\ntopics.\\\" It was Sydney Smith who said of Jeffrey he would \\\"damn the solar\\nsystem--bad light--planets too distant--pestered with comets. Feeble\\ncontrivance--could make a better with great ease.\\\"\\n\\nJeffrey reviewed Wordsworth and found in the \\\"Lyrical Ballads\\\"\\n\\\"vulgarity, affectation and silliness.\\\" He is alarmed, moreover, lest\\nhis \\\"childishness, conceit and affectation\\\" spread to other authors. He\\nproposes a poem to be called \\\"Elegiac Stanzas to a Sucking Pig,\\\" and of\\n\\\"Alice Fell\\\" he writes that \\\"if the publishing of such trash as this be\\nnot felt as an insult on the public taste, we are afraid it cannot be\\ninsulted.\\\" When the \\\"White Doe of Rylstone\\\" was published--no prime\\nfavorite, I confess, of my own--Jeffrey wrote that it had the merit of\\nbeing the very worst poem he ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume. \\\"It\\nseems to us,\\\" he wrote, \\\"to consist of a happy union of all the faults,\\nwithout any of the beauties, which belong to his school of poetry. It is\\njust such a work, in short, as some wicked enemy of that, school might be\\nsupposed to have devised, on purpose to make it ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\nLord Byron, on the publication of an early volume, is counselled \\\"that he\\ndo forthwith abandon poetry ... the mere rhyming of the final syllable,\\neven when accompanied by the presence of a certain number of feet ... is\\nnot the whole art of poetry. We would entreat him to believe,\\\" continued\\nthe reviewer, \\\"that a certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is\\nnecessary to constitute a poem; and that a poem in the present day, to\\nbe read, must contain at least one thought....\\\" It was this attack that\\nbrought forth Byron's \\\"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\\\"\\n\\nAs long as Jeffrey hoped to enlist Southey to write for the Edinburgh\\nReview, he treated him with some favor. But Southey took up with the\\nQuarterly. \\\"The Laureate,\\\" says the Edinburgh presently, \\\"has now been\\nout of song for a long time: But we had comforted ourselves with the\\nsupposition that he was only growing fat and lazy.... The strain, however,\\nof this publication, and indeed of some that went before it, makes us\\napprehensive that a worse thing has befallen him ... that the worthy\\ninditer of epics is falling gently into dotage.\\\"\\n\\nNow for the Quarterly Review, if by chance it can show an equal spleen!\\n\\nThere lived in the early days of the nineteenth century a woman by the name\\nof Lady Morgan, who was the author of several novels and books of travel.\\nAlthough her record in intelligence and morals is good, John Croker,\\nwho regularly reviewed her books, accuses her works of licentiousness,\\nprofligacy, irreverence, blasphemy, libertinism, disloyalty and atheism.\\nThere are twenty-six pages of this in one review only, and any paragraph\\nwould be worth the quoting for its ferocity. After this attack it was\\nMacaulay who said he hated Croker like \\\"cold boiled veal.\\\"\\n\\nThe Quarterly reviewed Keats' \\\"Endymion,\\\" although the writer naively\\nstates at the outset that he has not read the poem. \\\"Not that we have been\\nwanting in our duty,\\\" he writes, \\\"far from it--indeed, we have made efforts\\nalmost as superhuman as the story itself appears to be, to get through it;\\nbut with the fullest stretch of our perseverance we are forced to confess\\nthat we have not been able to struggle beyond the first of the four\\nbooks....\\\" Finally he questions whether Keats is the author's name, for\\nhe doubts \\\"that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a\\nrhapsody.\\\"\\n\\nLeigh Hunt's \\\"Rimini\\\" the Quarterly finds to be an \\\"ungrammatical,\\nunauthorized, chaotic jargon, such as we believe was never before spoken,\\nmuch less written.... We never,\\\" concludes the reviewer, \\\"in so few lines\\nsaw so many clear marks of the vulgar impatience of a low man, conscious\\nand ashamed of his wretched vanity, and labouring, with coarse flippancy,\\nto scramble over the bounds of birth and education, and fidget himself into\\nthe stout-heartedness of being familiar with a Lord.\\\" In a later review,\\nHunt is a propounder of atheism. \\\"Henceforth,\\\" says the reviewer, \\\"... he\\nmay slander a few more eminent characters, he may go on to deride venerable\\nand holy institutions, he may stir up more discontent and sedition, but he\\nwill have no peace of mind within ... he will live and die unhonoured\\nin his own generation, and, for his own sake it is to be hoped, moulder\\nunknown in those which are to follow.\\\"\\n\\nHazlitt belongs to a \\\"class of men by whom literature is more than at any\\nperiod disgraced.\\\" His style is suited for washerwomen, a \\\"class of\\nfemales with whom ... he and his friend Mr. Hunt particularly delight to\\nassociate.\\\"\\n\\nShelley, writes the Quarterly, \\\"is one of that industrious knot of authors,\\nthe tendency of whose works we have in our late Numbers exposed to the\\ncaution of our readers ... for with perfect deliberation and the steadiest\\nperseverance he perverts all the gifts of his nature, and does all the\\ninjury, both public and private, which his faculties enable him to\\nperpetrate.\\\" His \\\"poetry is in general a mere jumble of words and\\nheterogeneous ideas.\\\" \\\"The Cloud\\\" is \\\"simple nonsense.\\\" \\\"Prometheus\\nUnbound\\\" is a \\\"great storehouse of the obscure and unintelligible.\\\" In the\\n\\\"Sensitive Plant\\\" there is \\\"no meaning.\\\" And for Shelley himself, he is\\nguilty of a great many terrible things, including verbiage, impiety,\\nimmorality and absurdity.\\n\\nOf Blackwood's Magazine the special victims were Keats and Hunt and\\nColeridge. \\\"Mr. Coleridge,\\\" says the reviewer, \\\"... seems to believe that\\nevery tongue is wagging in his praise--that every ear is open to imbibe the\\noracular breathings of his inspiration ... no sound is so sweet to him as\\nthat of his own voice ... he seems to consider the mighty universe itself\\nas nothing better than a mirror in which, with a grinning and idiot\\nself-complacency, he may contemplate the physiognomy of Samuel Taylor\\nColeridge.... Yet insignificant as he assuredly is, he cannot put pen to\\npaper without a feeling that millions of eyes are fixed upon him....\\\"\\n\\nLeigh Hunt, says Blackwood, \\\"is a man of extravagant pretensions ...\\nexquisitely bad taste and extremely vulgar modes of thinking.\\\" His\\n\\\"Rimini\\\" \\\"is so wretchedly written that one feels disgust at its pretense,\\naffectation and gaudiness, ignorance, vulgarity, irreverence, quackery,\\nglittering and rancid obscenities.\\\"\\n\\nBlackwood's wrote of the \\\"calm, settled, imperturbable, drivelling idiocy\\nof Endymion,\\\" and elsewhere of Keats' \\\"prurient and vulgar lines, evidently\\nmeant for some young lady east of Temple Bar.... It is a better and a wiser\\nthing,\\\" it commented, \\\"to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so\\nback to the shop, Mr. John, back to 'plasters, pills and ointment\\nboxes.'\\\" And even when Shelley wrote his \\\"Adonais\\\" on the death of Keats,\\nBlackwood's met it with a contemptible parody:\\n\\n\\\"Weep for my Tom cat! all ye Tabbies weep!\\\"\\n\\nPerhaps I have quoted enough. This is the parentage of our silken and\\nflattering criticism.\\n\\nThe pages of these old reviews rest yellow on the shelves. From them there\\ncomes a smell of rotting leather, as though the infection spreads. The hour\\ngrows late. Like the ghost of the elder Hamlet, I detect the morning to be\\nnear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pursuit of Fire\\n\\n\\nReader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--whether they be sermons\\nto hurl across your pews, or sonnets in the Spring--doubtless you have\\nmoments when you sit at your desk bare of thoughts. Mother Hubbard's\\ncupboard when she went to seek the bone was not more empty. In such plight\\nyou chew your pencil as though it were stuff to feed your brain. Or if you\\nare of delicate taste, you fall upon your fingers. Or in the hope that\\nexercise will stir your wits, you pace up and down the room and press your\\nnose upon the window if perhaps the grocer's boy shall rouse you. Some\\npersons draw pictures on their pads or put pot-hooks on their letters--for\\ntalent varies--or they roughen up their hair. I knew one gifted fellow\\nwhose shoes presently would cramp him until he kicked them off, when at\\nonce the juices of his intellect would flow. Genius, I am told, sometimes\\nlocks its door and, if unrestrained, peels its outer wrappings. Or, in your\\npoverty, you run through the pages of a favorite volume, with a notebook\\nfor a sly theft to start you off. In what dejection you have fallen! It is\\nbest that you put on your hat and take your stupid self abroad.\\n\\nOr maybe you think that your creative fire will blaze, if instead of\\nthrowing in your wet raw thoughts, you feed it a few seasoned bits. You\\nopen, therefore, the drawer of your desk where you keep your rejected and\\nbroken fragments--for your past has not been prosperous--hopeful against\\nexperience that you can recast one of these to your present mood. This\\nis mournful business. Certain paragraphs that came from you hot are now\\npatched and shivery. Their finer meaning has run out between the lines as\\nthough these spaces were sluices for the proper drainage of the page. You\\nhad best put on your hat. You will get no comfort from these stale papers.\\n\\nOne evening lately, being in this plight, I spread out before me certain\\nodds and ends. I had dug deeper than usual in the drawer and had brought up\\na yellow stratum of a considerable age. I was poring upon these papers and\\nwas wondering whether I could fit them to a newer measure, when I heard a\\nslight noise behind me. I glanced around and saw that a man had entered the\\nroom and was now seated in a chair before the fire. In the common nature\\nof things this should have been startling, for the hour was late--twelve\\no'clock had struck across the way--and I had thought that I was quite\\nalone. But there was something so friendly and easy in his attitude--he\\nwas a young man, little more than a lanky boy--that instead of being\\nfrightened, I swung calmly around for a better look. He sat with his legs\\nstretched before him and with his chin resting in his hand, as though in\\nthought. By the light that fell on him from the fire, I saw that he wore a\\nbrown checked suit and that he was clean and respectable in appearance. His\\nface was in shadow.\\n\\n\\\"Good evening,\\\" I said, \\\"you startled me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry,\\\" he replied. \\\"I beg your pardon. I was going by and I saw your\\nlight. I wished to make your acquaintance. But I saw at once that I was\\nintruding, so I sat here. You were quite absorbed. Would you mind if I\\nmended the fire?\\\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for an answer, he took the poker and dealt the logs several\\nblows. It didn't greatly help the flame, but he poked with such enjoyment\\nthat I smiled. I have myself rather a liking for stirring a fire. He set\\nanother log in place. Then he drew from his pocket a handful of dried\\norange peel. \\\"I love to see it burn,\\\" he said. \\\"It crackles and spits.\\\" He\\nranged the peel upon the log where the flame would get it, and then settled\\nhimself in the big chair.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you smoke?\\\" I asked, pushing toward him a box of cigarettes.\\n\\nHe smiled. \\\"I thought that you would know my habits. I don't smoke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So you were going by and came up to see me?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I was not sure that I would know you. You are a little older than I\\nthought, a little--stouter, but dear me, how you have lost your hair! But\\nyou have quite forgotten me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear boy,\\\" I said, \\\"you have the advantage of me. Where have I seen\\nyou? There is something familiar about you and I am sure that I have seen\\nthat brown suit before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have never really known each other,\\\" the boy replied. \\\"We met once, but\\nonly for an instant. But I have thought of you since that meeting a great\\nmany times. I lay this afternoon on a hilltop and wondered what you would\\nbe like. But I hoped that sometimes you would think of me. Perhaps you have\\nforgotten that I used to collect railway maps and time-tables.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you?\\\" I replied. \\\"So did I when I was a little younger than you are.\\nPerhaps if I might see your face, I would know you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's nothing for show,\\\" he replied, and he kept it still in shadow. \\\"Would\\nyou mind,\\\" he said at length, \\\"if I ate an apple?\\\" He took one from his\\npocket and broke it in his hands. \\\"You eat half,\\\" he said.\\n\\nI accepted the part he offered me. \\\"Perhaps you would like a knife and\\nplate,\\\" I said. \\\"I can find them in the pantry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not for me,\\\" he replied. \\\"I prefer to eat mine this way.\\\" He took an\\nenveloping bite.\\n\\n\\\"I myself care nothing for plates,\\\" I said. We ate in silence. Presently:\\n\\\"You have my habit,\\\" I said, \\\"of eating everything, skin, seeds and all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everything but the stem,\\\" he replied.\\n\\nBy this time the orange peel was hissing and exploding.\\n\\n\\\"You are an odd boy,\\\" I said. \\\"I used to put orange peel away to dry in\\norder to burn it. We seem to be as like as two peas.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" he said, \\\"if that is so.\\\" He turned in his chair and faced me,\\nalthough his face was still in shadow. \\\"Doubtless, we are far different in\\nmany things. Do you swallow grape seeds?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hardly!\\\" I cried. \\\"I spit them out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am glad of that.\\\" He paused. \\\"It was a breezy hilltop where I lay. I\\nthought of you all afternoon. You are famous, of course?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear me, no!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm so sorry. I had hoped you might be. I had counted on it. It is\\nvery disappointing. I was thinking about that as I lay on the hill. But\\naren't you just on the point of doing something that will make you famous?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By no means.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear me, I am so sorry. Do you happen to be married?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And would you mind telling me her name?\\\"\\n\\nI obliged him.\\n\\n\\\"I don't remember to have heard of her. I didn't think of that name once\\nas I lay upon the hill. Things don't turn out as one might expect. Now, I\\nwould have thought--but it's no matter.\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment or so he was lost in thought, and then he spoke again: \\\"You\\nwere writing when I came into the room?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing important.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy ran his fingers in his hair and threw out his arms impatiently.\\n\\\"That's what I would like to do. I am in college, and I try for one of the\\npapers. But my stuff comes back. But this summer in the vacation, I am\\nworking in an office. I run errands and when there is nothing else to do, I\\nstudy a big invoice book, so as to get the names of things that are bought.\\nThere is a racket of drays and wagons outside the windows, and along in\\nthe middle of the afternoon I get tired and thick in my head. But I write\\nSaturday afternoons and Sunday mornings.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy stopped and fixed his eyes on me. \\\"I don't suppose that you happen\\nto be a poet?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" I replied. \\\"But perhaps you are one. Tell me about it!\\\"\\n\\nThe boy took a turn at the fire with the poker, but it was chiefly in\\nembarrassment. Presently he returned to his chair. He stretched his long\\narms upward above his head.\\n\\n\\\"No, I'm not,\\\" he said. \\\"And yet sometimes I think that I have a kind of\\npoetry in me. Only I can't get it into words. I lay thinking about that,\\ntoo, on the hillside. There was a wind above my head, and I thought that I\\ncould almost put words to the tune. But I have never written a single poem.\\nYet, goodness me, what thoughts I have! But they aren't real thoughts--what\\nyou would regularly call thoughts. Things go racing and tingling in my\\nhead, but I can never get them down. They are just feelings.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, the boy gazed intently through the chimney bricks out into\\nanother world. The fireplace was its portal and he seemed to wait for the\\nfires to cool before entering into its possession. It was several moments\\nbefore he spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want you to think me ridiculous, but so few understand. If only I\\ncould master the tools! Perhaps my thoughts are old, but they come to me\\nwith such freshness and they are so unexpected. Could I only solve the\\nfrets and spaces inside me here, I could play what tune I chose. But my\\nfeelings are cold and stale before I can get them into thoughts. I have no\\ndoubt, however, that they are just as real as those other feelings that in\\ntime, after much scratching, get into final form and become poetry. I\\nknow of course that a man's reach should exceed his grasp--it's hackneyed\\nenough--but just for once I would like to pull down something when I have\\nbeen up on tiptoe for a while.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes I get an impression of pity--a glance up a dark hallway--an old\\nwoman with a shawl upon her head--a white face at a window--a blind fiddler\\nin the street--but the impression is gone in a moment. Or a touch of beauty\\ngets me. It may be nothing but a street organ in the spring. Perhaps you\\nlike street organs, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do, indeed!\\\" I cried. \\\"There was one today outside my window and my feet\\nkept wiggling to it.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy clapped his hands. \\\"I knew that you would be like that. I hoped for\\nit on the hill. As for me, when I hear one, I'm so glad that I could cry\\nout. In its lilt there is the rhythm of life. It moves me more than a\\nhillside with its earliest flowers. Am I absurd? It is equal to the pipe of\\nbirds, to shallow waters and the sound of wind to stir me to thoughts of\\nApril. Today as I came downtown, I saw several merry fellows dancing on\\nthe curb. There are tunes, too, upon the piano that send me off. I play a\\nlittle myself. I see you have a piano. Do you still play?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A little, rather sadly,\\\" I replied.\\n\\n\\\"That's too bad, but perhaps you sing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Even worse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear me, that's too bad. I have rather a voice myself. Well, as I was\\nsaying, when I hear those tunes, I curl up with the smoke and blow forth\\nfrom the chimney. If I walk upon the street when the wind is up, and see a\\nlight fleece of smoke coming from a chimney top, I think that down below\\nsomeone is listening to music that he likes, and that his thoughts ride\\nupon the night, like those white streamers of smoke. And then I think of\\ncastles and mountains and high places and the sounds of storm. Or in fancy\\nI see a tower that tapers to the moon with a silver gleam upon it.\\\"\\n\\nThe strange boy lay back and laughed. \\\"Musicians think that they are the\\nonly ones that can hear the finer sounds. If one of us common fellows cocks\\nhis ear, they think that only the coarser thumps get inside. And artists\\nthink that they alone know the glory of color. I was thinking of that, this\\nafternoon. And yet I have walked under the blue sky. I have seen twilights\\nthat these men of paint would botch on canvas. But both musicians and\\nartists have a vision that is greater than their product. The soul of a man\\ncan hardly be recorded in black and white keys. Nor can a little pigment\\nwhich you rub upon your thumb be the measure of an artist. So I suppose\\nthat is the way also with poets. It is not to be expected that they can\\nexpress themselves fully in words that they have borrowed from the kitchen.\\nWhen their genius flames up, it is only the lesser sparks that fall upon\\ntheir writing pads. It consoles me that a man should be greater than his\\nachievement. I who have done so little would otherwise be so forlorn.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's odd,\\\" I said, when he had fallen into silence, \\\"that I used to feel\\nexactly as you do. It stirs an old recollection. If I am not mistaken, I\\nonce wrote a paper on the subject.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy smiled dreamily. \\\"But if small persons like myself,\\\" he began, \\\"can\\nhave such frenzies, how must it be with those greater persons who have\\namazed the world? I have wondered in what kind of exaltation Shakespeare\\nwrote his storm in 'Lear.' There must have been a first conception greater\\neven than his accomplishment. Did he look from his windows at a winter\\ntempest and see miserable old men and women running hard for shelter? Did\\na flash of lightning bare his soul to the misery, the betrayal and the\\nmadness of the world? His supreme moment was not when he flung the\\ncompleted manuscript aside, or when he heard the actors mouth his lines,\\nbut in the flash and throb of creation--in the moment when he knew that he\\nhad the power in him to write 'Lear.' What we read is the cold forging,\\nwonderful and enduring, but not to be compared to the producing furnace.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy had spoken so fast that he was out of breath.\\n\\n\\\"Hold a bit!\\\" I cried. \\\"What you have said sounds familiar. Where could I\\nhave heard it before?\\\"\\n\\nThere was something almost like a sneer on the boy's face. \\\"What a memory\\nyou have! And perhaps you recall this brown suit, too. It's ugly enough to\\nbe remembered. Now please let me finish what came to me this afternoon on\\nthe hill! Prometheus,\\\" he continued, \\\"scaled the heavens and brought back\\nfire to mortals. And he, as the story goes, clutched at a lightning bolt\\nand caught but a spark. And even that, glorious. Mankind properly accredits\\nhim with a marvellous achievement. It is for this reason that I comfort\\nmyself although I have not yet written a single line of verse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear fellow,\\\" I said, \\\"please tell me where I have read something like\\nwhat you have spoken?\\\"\\n\\nThe boy's answer was irrelevant. \\\"You first tell me what you did with a\\nbrown checked suit you once owned.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never owned but one brown suit,\\\" I replied, \\\"and that was when I was\\nstill in college. I think that I gave it away before it was worn out.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy once more clapped his hands. \\\"Oh, I knew it, I knew it. I'll give\\nmine tomorrow to the man who takes our ashes. Now, won't you please play\\nthe piano for me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Assuredly. Choose your tune!\\\"\\n\\nHe fumbled a bit in the rack and passing some rather good music, he held up\\na torn and yellow sheet. \\\"This is what I want,\\\" he said.\\n\\nI had not played it for many years. After a false start or so--for it was\\nvillainously set in four sharps for which I have an aversion--I got through\\nit. On a second trial I did better.\\n\\nThe boy made no comment. He had sunk down in his chair until he was quite\\nout of sight. \\\"Well,\\\" I said, \\\"what next?\\\"\\n\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\nI arose from the bench and glanced in his direction. \\\"Hello,\\\" I cried,\\n\\\"what has become of you?\\\"\\n\\nThe chair was empty. I turned on all the lights. He was nowhere in sight. I\\nshook the hangings. I looked under my desk, for perhaps the lad was hiding\\nfrom me in jest. It was unlikely that he could have passed me to gain the\\ndoor, but I listened at the sill for any sound upon the stairs. The hall\\nwas silent. I called without response. Somewhat bewildered I came back to\\nthe hearth. Only a few minutes before, as it seemed, there had been a brisk\\nfire with a row of orange peel upon the upper log. Now all trace of the\\npeel was gone and the logs had fallen to a white ash.\\n\\nI was standing perplexed, when I observed that a little pile of papers lay\\non the rug just off the end of my desk as by a careless elbow. At least,\\nI thought, this impolite fellow has forgotten some of his possessions. It\\nwill serve him right if it is poetry that he wrote upon the hilltop.\\n\\nI picked up the papers. They were yellow and soiled, and writing was\\nscrawled upon them. At the top was a date--but it was twenty years old.\\nI turned to the last sheet. At least I could learn the boy's name. To my\\namazement, I saw at the bottom in an old but familiar writing, not the\\nboy's name, but my own.\\n\\nI gazed at the chimney bricks and their substance seemed to part before my\\neyes. I looked into a world beyond--a fabric of moonlight and hilltop and\\nthe hot fret of youth. Perhaps the boy had only been waiting for the fire\\nupon the hearth to cool to enter this other world of his restless ambition\\nand desire.\\n\\nReader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--let us confine\\nourselves now to sonnets and such airy matter as rides upon the\\nnight--doubtless, you sit sometimes at your desk bare of thoughts. The\\njuices of your intellect are parched and dry. In such plight, I beg you\\nnot to fall upon your fingers or to draw pictures on your sheet.

One pound of cottage\\ncheese contains most of the protein, calcium, phosphorous, iron, and\\nvitamins found in three quarts of milk.\\n\\nThree ounces of cottage cheese furnishes about 50% of an adult\\u2019s daily\\nrequirement for calcium.\\n\\nCottage cheese is a complete protein (builds, repairs, and maintains\\nbody tissue); therefore, it is particularly desirable for growing\\nchildren and is an ideal food for adults.\\n\\nCottage cheese is easily digested and readily assimilated. It is an\\nimportant food for the person desiring to lose weight because of its\\nhigh nutritive value and low caloric content. One ounce of creamed\\ncottage cheese supplies about 30 calories.\\n\\nIn addition to its concentrated food value, cottage cheese is also a\\nvery versatile food. It can be served in a variety of tempting ways\\nbecause it combines nicely with almost any type of food.\\n\\n    [Illustration: WHAT BECOMES OF THE MILK DISTRIBUTOR\\u2019S DOLLAR]\\n\\n SALARIES & WAGES                                                    .2080\\n    Cost of Raw Milk delivered at the plant                 .5146[1]\\n    Other Material Costs\\u2014cream, skim milk, chocolate, etc.  .1039\\n MATERIAL COSTS                                                      .6185\\n INSURANCE, DEPRECIATION & ALL OTHER EXPENSE                         .0304\\n CONTAINERS, BOTTLES, CANS, ETC.                                     .0405\\n PLANT DELIVERY & OFFICE SUPPLIES                                    .0525\\n TAXES & LICENSES                                                    .0217\\n ADVERTISING                                                         .0078\\n NET OPER.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\u2019s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\u2122 and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\u2019s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\u2019s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\u2122 electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg\\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\u2122,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}],"source":["# load the books\n","filepath = Path('./rag_part1')\n","books = pd.read_csv(filepath / \"books.csv\")\n","books.columns = ['title', 'text']\n","print(\"Shape:\", books.shape)\n","# Visualize the first rows of the Pandas Dataframe containing the books\n","books.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"YxqnCK4kZSB6","metadata":{"id":"YxqnCK4kZSB6"},"source":["### Data inspection\n","\n","Each row is a book.

PREFACE This volume, which is the second of the Woman's Institute Library of Cookery, deals with such essentials of diet as the dairy products--milk, butter, and cheese--the protein food, eggs, and the energy-producing nutrients, vegetables. In _Milk, Butter, and Cheese_, Parts 1 and 2, are explained the place that milk occupies in the diet, its composition, grades, and the dishes for which it is used; the purchase, care, and use of butter and butter substitutes; and the characteristics, care, and varieties of both domestic and imported cheeses, as well as a number of excellent recipes for cheese dishes. A luncheon menu, in which a cheese dish is substituted for meat, is of interest in this connection, for it shows the housewife, early in her studies, not only how to combine dishes to produce a balanced meal, but also how to make up a menu in which meat is not needed. In _Eggs_ are discussed the nutritive value of eggs, the ways in which to select, preserve, cook, and serve them, and how to utilize left-over eggs. So many uses have eggs in the diet and so nourishing is this food that too much attention cannot be paid to its preparation. In this lesson, also, is given a breakfast menu to afford practice in preparing several simple dishes usually served in this meal. In _Vegetables_, Parts 1 and 2, every variety of vegetable is discussed as to food value, preparation, place in the meal, and proper methods of serving. With such a fund of knowledge, the housewife will be well equipped to give pleasing variety to her meals. In addition to the instruction in these matters, there are a large number of illustrations, which make clear the important details in every process employed and in many recipes show certain steps as well as the finished result. With such detailed information, it is our desire that as many of the recipes as possible be tried, for it is only through constant practice that the rules and principles of cookery will become thoroughly instilled in the mind. Nothing is of more value to the housewife than such a knowledge of food and its preparation, for, as every one knows, proper diet is the chief requisite of good health. To be of the greatest assistance to the woman in the home is the purpose of these volumes--to relieve her household tasks of much of their drudgery and to help her come to a realization of the opportunity for good that is hers. In no better way can she create happiness and contentment in her home than by preparing appetizing, nutritious meals and serving them in the most attractive manner.

As is well understood, milk is the liquid that is secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals for the nourishment of their young. The word milk as it is commonly used, however, refers to _cow's milk,_ because such milk is employed to a greater extent as human food than the milk from any other animal. Cow's milk in its perfectly fresh raw state is a yellowish-white, opaque fluid, called _whole milk,_ and, as is well known, possesses a distinctly sweet taste and characteristic odor. When such milk is allowed to stand for some time without being disturbed, it separates into two distinct layers, an upper and a lower one. The upper layer, which is lighter than the lower one and occupies a smaller space, consists largely of globules of fat and is called _cream;_ the lower layer, which is white or bluish-white in color and is composed of water, solids, and protein, is, when separated from the cream, called _skim milk._ 2. As an article of diet, milk is very important, because its sole function in nature is to serve as food. It is required by the infant; it is needed in the diet of all growing children; and it is desirable in the preparation of dishes for both young and old. Milk is used to such a great extent because it fills many of the requirements of an ideal food. It is generally liked, requires little or no time for preparation, agrees with the majority of persons when used properly, and contains substances that supply energy and build and repair tissue. Still, it does not contain these substances in such proportions as to make it an ideal or exclusive article of diet for adults, and it must often be modified to suit the needs of infants, because it is ideal for only the young of the species for which it is intended. Therefore, while milk is often called a perfect food, in reality it is perfect for only the calf. When it is desired for the feeding of a very young child, it must be changed to meet the requirements before it can be used with good results. 3. So important is milk as an article of food that, outside of the purely rural districts, producing the milk supply is a business of considerable importance. This is due to the fact that the purity of milk must be constantly safeguarded in order that clean, safe milk may be provided for the countless numbers that depend on it. In fact, milk undoubtedly bears a closer relation to public health than any other food. To produce an adequate amount of clean, safe, pure milk is one of the food problems of the city and country alike. In the city much of the difficulty is overcome by the ordinances that provide standards of composition and cleanliness, as well as inspection to insure them; but such ordinances are rarely provided for in villages and country districts. When there is no law to prevent it, unclean milk is sometimes used in the manufacture of butter and cheese, but when this happens, great injustice, if not positive harm, is done to the consumers of these articles. Then, too, unless milk is carefully inspected, tubercular milk is liable to be used in the making of butter, and such a condition will cause the spreading of tuberculosis as readily as the use of the contaminated milk itself. 4. With its various products, milk helps to form a very large part of the dietary in most homes, but while nothing can take the place of this food and while it is high in food value, there seems to be a general tendency to think of it as an addition to the bill of fare, rather than as a possible substitute for more expensive food. For instance, milk is very often served as a beverage in a meal in which the quantity of meat or other protein foods is not reduced. From an economical standpoint, as well as from the point of view of the needs of the body, this is really extravagant, for milk is itself largely a protein food. The serving of a glass of milk or of a dish that contains generous quantities of milk offers the housewife an opportunity to cut down considerably the allowance of meat and eggs. Because of this fact and because milk and its products may be used to add nutritive value to a food, to give variety, and to improve flavor, they deserve considerable study on the part of the housewife. 5. Since milk may be used in such a variety of ways, it may be easily included in the dietary for the family. Being liquid in form, it may always be served without any preparation as a beverage or with other beverages, cereals, and fruits. It also has numerous other uses, being employed in the making of sauces for vegetables and meats, in the place of stock for soups, and as the liquid for bread, cakes, puddings, custards, and many frozen desserts. Because of its extensive use, every housewife not only should know how to buy milk and care for it, but should be familiar with its composition, so that she may determine whether or not it suits the needs of her family. In addition, she should know the effect of heat on milk and the various methods of preparation if she would be able to judge what food combinations can be used with milk. COMPOSITION OF MILK 6. As milk is usually taken into the body in liquid form, the common tendency is to regard it as a beverage, rather than as an important source of nourishing food material. However, a knowledge of its composition, as well as the fact that milk becomes a solid food in the stomach and must then be dissolved in the process of digestion, will serve to show that milk contains solids. That it possesses all the elements required to sustain life and promote health is proved by the fact that a child may live for months on milk alone and during this time increase in weight. 7. The solids contained in milk are proteins, fat, carbohydrate in the form of sugar, and mineral salts, besides which, of course, water occurs in large quantities. The sugar and fat of milk serve as fuel; the mineral salts are chiefly valuable for the growth of bones and teeth and for their effect on the liquids of the body; and the proteins, like the fat and sugar, serve as fuel, but they also make and repair the muscular tissues of the body. In considering the food substances of milk, it will be well to note also that they vary according to the breed, feeding, and individual characteristics of the cow. Jerseys and Guernseys give milk rich in fat and total solids, and while Holstein cows give a greater quantity of milk, such milk has a smaller proportion of fat and total solids. As a rule, though, the composition of milk may be considered as approximately 3.3 per cent. protein, 4 per cent. fat, 5 per cent. carbohydrate, and .7 per cent. mineral matter, making a total of 13 per cent. This indicates the quantity of actual food material in milk, the remainder, or 87 per cent., being water. 8. PROTEIN IN MILK.--Because of the double usefulness of protein--to serve as fuel and to make and repair muscular tissue--this element is regarded as an important ingredient of milk. The protein in milk is called _casein_. The opaque whiteness of milk is largely due to the presence of this substance. As long as milk remains sweet, the lime salts it contains hold this casein in solution; but when it sours, the salts are made soluble and the casein thickens, or coagulates. In addition to casein, milk contains a small amount of protein in the form of _albumin_. This substance, upon being heated, coagulates and causes the formation of the skin that is always found on the top of milk that has been heated. The skin thus formed contains everything that is found in milk, because, as it forms, casein is dried with it and sugar and fat, too, are caught and held there. It is the protein of milk and its characteristic coagulation that are made use of in the making of cheese. In cooking, the protein of milk is probably more affected than any of the other substances, but the degree to which the digestion of milk is thus affected is not definitely known, this being a much disputed question. 9. FAT IN MILK.--The other substance in milk that serves as fuel, or to produce energy, is fat. It occurs in the form of tiny particles, each surrounded by a thin covering and suspended in the liquid. Such a mixture, which is called an _emulsion_, is the most easily digested form in which fat is found. The fat in milk varies more than the other food substances, it being sometimes as low as 2 per cent, and again as high as 6 per cent. However, the average of these two, or 4 per cent., is the usual amount found in most milk. As has been mentioned, the fat globules of milk rise to the top because fat is lighter than water, so that when milk has been undisturbed for some time the top, which is known as _cream_, will be found to contain most of the fat. Because of the fat it contains, the cream is yellower in color than the milk underneath. If the cream is beaten, or churned, these fat particles will adhere in a mass, advantage of this fact being taken in the making of butter. 10. CARBOHYDRATE IN MILK.--The carbohydrate contained in milk is in the form of sugar called _lactose_. It is unlike other sugars in that it is not very sweet and does not disagree with most persons nor upset their digestion. For this reason, it is often given to children, invalids, and persons who have digestive disturbances. However, it is like other carbohydrates in that in solution it ferments. The result of the fermentation in this case is the production of _lactic acid_, which makes the milk sour. With the fat, lactose makes up the bulk of the energy-producing material of milk, and while this is important it is only secondary when compared to the tissue-building power of the protein and minerals. Besides being an important part of milk itself, lactose is a valuable by-product in the manufacture of cheese. After being taken from _whey_, which is the clear, straw-colored liquid that remains when the curd, or coagulated portion, is completely removed from the milk, the lactose is refined and sold in the form of a powder that is used for various kinds of infant and invalid feeding. 11. MINERAL MATTER IN MILK.--Considerable quantities of mineral salts, which are chiefly _lime_, _potash_, and _phosphates_, are found in milk. As has already been pointed out, these are important in the building of bone and hard tissue in the body, but in addition they help to keep the fluids of the body in the right condition. Because of the work they do, these mineral salts are necessary in the building of the bodies of growing children, and are useful for repair and the regulation of the body processes in adults. In cheese, butter, and cream, which are the products of milk, less of the mineral salts are found in proportion to the quantity than in whole milk, skim milk, and whey. 12. WATER IN MILK.--The percentage of water in milk is much greater than that of all the other food substances combined, there being more than six times as much. While this quantity seems very large, it is an advantage, for milk provides nourishment to persons when they can take neither solid nor more condensed food. On the other hand, the water is a disadvantage, for it is responsible for the rapid spoiling of milk. This fact is clearly shown in the case of condensed milk, where the water is partly or completely evaporated, for milk of this kind keeps much longer without spoiling than either whole or skim milk. PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM MILK 13. Although milk is used extensively in its natural liquid form, considerable use is also made of the numerous products of milk, chief among which are cream, skim milk, buttermilk, sour milk, whey, butter, and cheese. In fact, all of these occupy such an important place in the dietary of the majority of homes that it is well for every housewife to understand their value. Butter and cheese are discussed in detail later, so that at this time no attention need be given to them. The other products, however, are taken up now, with the intention of enabling the housewife to familiarize herself with their production, nature, and use. 14. CREAM.--As has been pointed out, the particles of fat that rise to the top of milk when it is allowed to remain undisturbed for some time form the product known as cream. Cream may be removed from the milk by skimming it off, or it may be separated from the milk by means of machinery especially designed for the purpose. The greater the proportion of fat in milk, the thicker, or \\\"heavier,\\\" will be the cream. Various grades of separated cream are placed on the market, the usual ones being those which contain 8, 12, 16, 20, and 40 per cent, of fat. Thin cream, which includes the grades that have only a small percentage of fat, contains a larger quantity of milk than the others and is not so desirable for many purposes. Still, it is used to some extent, because it is cheaper and there are definite uses to which it can be put. Medium-heavy cream is the kind to select when it is desired for _whipping_. This is a process that consists in beating the cream rapidly until a mass of tiny bubbles form and become stiff, very much as the white of egg does. 15. SKIM MILK.--After a part or all of the cream has been removed from whole milk, that which remains is called skim milk. While practically all of the fat is taken out when milk is skimmed, very little protein or sugar is removed. Therefore, skim milk is still a valuable food, it being used to a large extent for cheese making, for the manufacture of certain commercial foods, and for the feeding of animals. The housewife does not, as a rule, buy skim milk; indeed, in some localities the laws prevent its sale because it is considered an adulterated food. However, it is really a wholesome, valuable food that is cheaper than whole milk, and its use in the home should therefore be encouraged from an economical standpoint. Here it may be used in the preparation of many dishes, such as sauces, cakes, biscuits, muffins, griddle cakes, bread, etc., in which butter or other fats are used, and in custards, puddings, ices, and numerous other desserts. 16. BUTTERMILK.--The milk that remains in butter making after the butter fat has been removed from cream by churning is known by the name buttermilk. Such milk is similar to skim milk in composition, and unless butter is made of sweet cream, buttermilk is sour. Buttermilk is used considerably as a beverage, but besides this use there are numerous ways in which it may be employed in the preparation of foods, as is pointed out in various recipes. An advantage of buttermilk is that its cost is less than that of whole milk, so that the housewife will do well to make use of it in the preparation of those foods in which it produces satisfactory results. 17. ARTIFICIAL BUTTERMILK.--Several kinds of sour milk that are called buttermilk are to be had, particularly at soda fountains and restaurants. While they are similar to buttermilk they are not the same, because they are produced artificially from whole or skimmed sweet milk. The usual method employed in the making of these artificial buttermilks, as they may well be called, consists in adding to sweet milk tablets containing lactic acid or a certain culture of bacteria that induce fermentation, very much as yeast does, and then keeping it at about body temperature for a number of hours in order to allow the milk to thicken and sour. Such milks exert a beneficial action in the digestive tract, and their food value, provided they are made from whole milk, is just as high as that of the original sweet milk. Artificial buttermilks therefore prove a valuable source of food supply for persons who find them palatable and who do not care for sweet milk. Their food value may be increased by adding cream to them. 18. SOUR MILK.--Ordinary milk contains large numbers of bacteria that produce fermentation. When it is allowed to stand for some time, these bacteria act upon the sugar, or lactose, contained in the milk and change it into lactic acid. This acid gives to the milk a sour taste and at the same time causes the casein of the milk to become a mass known as _curd_, or _clabber_. This mass continues to grow sour and tough until all the milk sugar is converted into lactic acid, so that the longer the milk stands, the more acid it becomes. Sour milk, however, is useful in the preparation of various dishes, such as hot breads and griddle cakes. [Illustration: FIG. 1] 19. WHEY.--When the curd is completely removed from milk, as in making cheese, a clear, light, yellowish liquid known as whey remains. Whey is composed of water, minerals, and milk sugar or lactic acid, and is the least valuable part of the milk. The ingenious housewife will never be at a loss to make use of this product, for, while its food value is slight, the minerals it contains are important ones. Whey is sometimes used to furnish the liquid for bread making and, in addition, it may be used as a beverage for persons who cannot digest food as heavy as milk itself. 20. COMPARISON OF FOOD VALUES OF MILK PRODUCTS.--So that the housewife may become familiar with the food values of milk products, there is here given, in Fig. 1, a graphic table for the comparison of such products. Each glass is represented as containing approximately 1 pint or 1 pound of the milk product, and the figures underneath each indicate the number of calories found in the quantity represented. The triangle at the side of each indicates the proportion of ash, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and water, the percentage composition being given at the side. Housewives as a rule fully appreciate the food value that is to be found in whole milk and cream, but such products as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are likely to be ignored. CHARACTERISTICS OF WHOLESOME MILK 21. So far as the housewife is concerned, the qualities that characterize wholesome milk are without doubt of great interest. She may know of what use milk is in the diet and the food substances of which it is composed, but unless she understands just what constitutes milk of good quality, as well as the nature of inferior milk, she cannot very well provide her family with the kind it should have. Therefore, to assist her in this matter, the characteristics of wholesome milk are here discussed. Such milk, it will be well to note, must be of the right composition, must not be adulterated, must be fresh--that is, not older when delivered than is permitted by law--and must be as clean as possible. 22. STANDARD OF MILK COMPOSITION.--The housewife usually judges the quality of milk by the amount of cream that rises to the top when milk in a bottle is allowed to remain undisturbed for some time. This is really an excellent test, because milk that contains only a small amount of cream is of poorer quality than that which contains a larger amount; in other words, the more cream milk contains, the higher will be its food value and the greater its energy-producing ability. Then, too, milk that is rich in cream usually contains proportionately large amounts of protein and sugar. While the composition of milk has much to do with the quality of this food, it varies, as should be noted, in different breeds and even in individual cows, depending on both the food and the care given to them. For this reason, milk that is mixed is preferable to the milk of a single cow, as the mixing of the milk of a number of cows insures a better average composition. 23. ADULTERATION OF MILK.--The composition of milk, and hence its quality, is seriously affected by its adulteration. By this is meant the extraction of any of the food substances from whole milk; the addition of anything that tends to weaken or lower its quality or strength; the use of coloring matter to make it appear of greater value than it actually is; or the use of preservatives to prevent it from souring as soon as it ordinarily would. It is, of course, illegal to adulterate milk, yet it is sometimes done. The most convenient and possibly the most common materials used to adulterate milk are water and skim milk. The addition of water to milk decreases the quantity of all its food substances, but the addition of skim milk reduces the quantity of fat only. The color of the milk is often affected by the use of these adulterants, but when this happens, yellow coloring is usually added to restore the original appearance. Sometimes the milk that a dairyman markets contains more fat than the law requires; but even such milk cannot legally be skimmed nor diluted with skim milk. The only thing that may be done to it is to mix it with milk that is low in butter fat and thus obtain a milk that will average the legal percentage. For instance, if milk from a dairy averages 5 per cent, of butter fat, it may be diluted with milk that contains only 3 per cent, of butter fat, because the result of such mixing, which will be milk averaging 4 per cent, of this food substance, will be the legal standard. 24. To prevent milk from souring, dishonest milk dealers often put into it such preservatives as soda, borax, and formaldehyde. There is no definite way of telling whether or not one of these has been used, except by a chemical analysis. However, if milk does not sour within a reasonable time when no precautions have been taken to keep it sweet, it should be looked on with suspicion, for it undoubtedly contains a preservative. 25. FRESHNESS OF MILK.--To be most satisfactory for all purposes, milk should be absolutely fresh. However, it is almost impossible to obtain milk in this condition, because it is generally sold at a distance from the source of supply. Milk that is sold in small towns and cities is usually 12 and often 18 to 21 hours old when it is delivered; whereas, in large cities, where the demand is so great that milk must be shipped from great distances, it is often 24 to 36 or even 48 hours old when it reaches the consumer. In order that milk may remain sweet long enough to permit it to be delivered at places so far removed from the source of supply, it must be handled and cared for in the cleanest possible way by the dealers. Likewise, if the housewife desires to get the best results from it, she must follow the same plan, cooling it immediately on delivery and keeping it cool until it is consumed. The freshness of milk can be determined only by the length of time it will remain sweet when proper care is given to it. 26. CLEANLINESS OF MILK.--Milk may be of the right composition, free from all adulteration, and as fresh as it is possible to obtain it, but unless it is clean, it is an injurious food. Milk is rendered unclean or impure by dirt. In reality, there are two kinds of dirt that may be present in milk, and it is important to know just what these are and what effect they have on milk. 27. The less harmful of the two kinds of dirt is the visible dirt that gets into the milk from the cow, the stable, the milker, the milking utensils, and similar sources when these are not scrupulously clean. If milk containing such dirt is allowed to stand long enough in pans or bottles for the heavier particles to settle, it will be found as sediment in the bottom of the receptacle. To say the least, the presence of such dirt is always disagreeable and frequently produces foreign flavors. Straining the milk through clean absorbent cotton will reveal the presence of such dirt and another kind of dirt that does not show through the opaque fluid. This second kind of dirt is generally found in milk when the first kind is present in any quantity. It is more liable to be harmful than the other, because it enters the milk from the water used in cleaning the receptacles or from some contaminated source. [Illustration: FIG. 2] 28. Whenever dirt is present in milk, bacteria are sure to be there; and the greater the quantity of dirt the greater will be the number of bacteria. Should the housewife desire to compare the cleanliness of several lots of milk, she may filter a like quantity from each lot, say a quart or a pint, through small disks of absorbent cotton. If, after the milk has passed through the cotton disk, very little dirt remains on it, as in Fig. 2 (_a_), the milk may be considered as comparatively clean; if the cotton disk appears as in (_b_), the milk may be said to be only slightly dirty; if it appears as in (_c_), the milk is dirty; and if it appears as in (_d_), the milk is very dirty. Milk that leaves a stain like that in (_d_) contains more bacteria than milk that leaves a stain like that in (_c_), and so on through all the lots of milk. Filtering milk in this manner, however, does not indicate whether the bacteria are disease producing. Such information can be secured only by microscopic examination, and only then by persons who have a knowledge of such matters. 29. Since, as has been pointed out, bacteria cling to all dirt, the dirt that milk contains is one of the causes of souring and putrefaction of milk, and may be a cause of disease. Indeed, it is definitely known that dirty milk sours much more quickly than does clean milk. Actual tests in which clean milk was put in a cool place have proved that it will keep for weeks, whereas dirty milk will sour in a day or two, especially in warm weather. This information should point out clearly to the housewife that it is not merely heat that changes milk or causes it to sour. She should understand in addition, that bacteria grow and multiply very rapidly when conditions for their growth are provided. These conditions are moisture, warmth, and the right kind of food, and as all of these are found in milk, this product is really ideal for bacterial development. The only way in which to protect milk is to make sure that no bacteria enter it, or, if they do, to make it impossible for them to grow. This may be done by keeping the milk so cold that they cannot thrive, or by destroying them in various ways, which are taken up later. 30. In former times, there was not much danger of wide-spread disease from the milk supply, for it was cared for almost entirely by those who kept a few cows and distributed milk to a small number of customers. In fact, it has been only within the past 50 years that large quantities of milk are handled by separate dairies and shipped great distances from the source of supply and that the distribution of milk has become a great industry. When so much milk is handled in one place, it is more or less unsafe unless the dairy is kept extremely clean and is conducted in the most sanitary manner. Experience has shown that too much attention cannot be given to the care of milk, for the lives of great numbers of children have been sacrificed through the carelessness of dairymen and persons selling and distributing milk, as well as through the negligence of those who handle the milk after it has entered the home. To overcome much of this carelessness, both the Federal Government and the various states of this country have set standards for safe milk production, and in order to make their laws effective have established inspection service. Independently of these state and national laws, many of the cities, particularly the large ones, have made their own standards, which, as a rule, are very rigid. One of the usual requirements is to compel each person who wishes to sell milk in the city to buy a license, so that the city authorities may keep in touch with those handling milk and so that conditions may be investigated at any time. In view of the care required of dealers in handling milk, the housewife owes it to herself and the members of her family to keep the milk in the home in the best possible manner. GRADES OF CLEAN MILK 31. Ever since milk has come to be a commercial product, authorities have been devising ways in which it may be brought to the consumer in a condition that will permit it to be used without causing ill results. Their efforts have been rewarded to such an extent that nowadays consumers have little to fear from the milk they purchase, provided they get it from dealers who live up to the laws. Chief among the different grades of clean milk is _certified milk,_ and next in order comes _pasteurized milk,_ followed by _sterilized milk_. 32. CERTIFIED MILK.--The grade of clean milk sold under the name of certified milk is simply natural, raw milk that is produced and marketed under conditions that permit it to be guaranteed as pure, wholesome, and of definite composition. Such milk is necessarily higher in price than milk that is less wholesome and sanitary, because of the extra cost to the dairyman in meeting the requirements that make it possible for him to produce clean milk under sanitary conditions. These requirements pertain to the health and cleanliness of those who handle the milk, to the health, housing condition, and care of the herd and the dairy cows, and to the handling and care of milk in the dairy and during transportation and delivery. They are usually established and enforced by an inspection commission appointed by the city, county, or state in which the milk is produced. 33. If a little careful thought is given to the milk situation, it will be admitted that such precautions are necessary if clean milk is to be the result. Such milk cannot be produced if the surroundings are dirty, because dust and flies, which are two sources of contamination, are practically always present in such places. A stable with poor ventilation, without screens to keep out flies, and with floors that will not permit of cleaning, but cause filth and refuse to accumulate, is sure to contaminate milk that is handled in it. In addition, cows that are not well fed, comfortably housed, or carefully groomed cannot be expected to give milk of as good quality as cows that are properly cared for. Likewise, if the persons who do the milking are not clean, the milk is subject to contamination from this source. 34. All such unfavorable conditions can be remedied, and must be in the production of certified milk; but the good accomplished in this direction will be lost if the milk is carelessly handled after milking. Therefore, in producing certified milk, only the cleanest water available is allowed to be used in the dairy. Impure water is a common source of the contamination of milk in such places. On some farms, the water supply comes from a well that is too near the barn or that is too shallow to avoid being made impure by the germs that filter into it from the barnyard or a cesspool. If vessels in which milk is placed are washed in such water, it is necessary to sterilize them by boiling or steaming before milk is put into them, in order to kill the germs that come from the water. If such a precaution as this is not observed, the germs will multiply rapidly in the milk and, provided they are disease-producing, will make the milk extremely dangerous. Besides observing the precautions mentioned, it is necessary that all utensils used in a dairy, such as pails for milking, strainers, containers, etc., be kept scrupulously clean. Likewise, they must be sterilized by boiling each time they are used, for, while disease germs may be absent, those which cause the milk to sour are always present and must be destroyed. Finally, to prevent any germs that enter milk from multiplying, even when it is properly cared for, the milk has to be cooled to a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or lower immediately after milking and then bottled in sterilized bottles, sealed, and packed in ice, within 20 minutes after milking. 35. It is by giving attention to all such matters that certified milk is possible. Such milk, as will be understood from what has been said, is neither a cooked milk nor a dirty milk that is processed, but a natural, raw milk that is clean at all stages of its production and marketing. Because of this fact, it is the best and cleanest milk to be had and may be used without hesitation, not only by grown persons in good health, but for infants and invalids. The sanitary condition of certified milk and the consequent length of time it will remain sweet was demonstrated conclusively as far back as 1900 at the Paris Exposition. At this time, two model dairies in the United States--one located at the University of Illinois and the other at Briarcliff Manor, Westchester County, New York--delivered to their booths at the Exposition milk that was bottled under the most sanitary conditions at their dairies. During its transit across the ocean the milk was kept at a temperature of 40 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and on its arrival, 2 weeks after leaving the dairies, it was found to be in a perfectly sweet condition. Similar experiments made at later dates, such as shipping certified milk from the East to California, serve to bear out the test made in 1900, and prove what can be done with milk so produced as to be as free as possible from bacteria or the conditions that permit their growth. 36. PASTEURIZED MILK.--While certified milk is undoubtedly the safest kind of milk to use and is constantly growing in favor, much of the milk received in the home is pasteurized. By pasteurized milk is meant milk that has been heated to a temperature of 140 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, kept at this temperature for 15 to 20 minutes, and then cooled rapidly. The result of such a treatment is that any disease-producing germs that are present in the milk, as well as those which are likely to cause intestinal disturbances, are destroyed, and that the milk is rendered safe as food for a time. Pasteurizing does not materially change the taste of milk, nor does it seriously affect the digestive properties of this food. It is true, of course, that pasteurized milk is not so good as clean raw milk. Still it is better to use such milk than to run the risk of using milk that might be contaminated with the germs of tuberculosis, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or any other of the numerous diseases that have been known to be carried to whole families and communities through the milk supply. 37. Although pasteurizing is done on a large scale in dairies, there is no reason why the housewife cannot pasteurize the milk she buys, provided it is raw milk and she feels that it is not safe to use. If pasteurizing is to be done frequently and large quantities of milk are to be treated, it would be advisable to purchase the convenient apparatus that is to be had. However, if only a small quantity of milk is to be pasteurized at a time, a simple improvised outfit will prove satisfactory, because milk pasteurized in the home may be heated in the bottles in which it is received. Such an outfit consists of a dairy thermometer, a deep vessel, and a perforated pie tin or a wire rack of suitable size. 38. To pasteurize milk in the home, proceed in the manner illustrated in Fig. 3. Place the rack or invert the perforated pie tin in the bottom of the vessel, and on it place the bottles of milk from which the caps have not been removed. Make a hole through the cap of one bottle, and insert the thermometer into the milk through this hole. Then fill the vessel with cold water to within an inch or so of the top of the bottles, taking care not to put in so much water as to make the bottles float. Place the vessel over the fire, heat it until the thermometer in the bottle registers a few degrees over 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and keep the milk at this temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. At the end of this time, the milk will be sufficiently pasteurized and may be removed from the fire. As soon as it is taken from the water, cool it as rapidly as possible by running cold water into the vessel slowly or by placing the bottles in several changes of water, taking care not to place the hot bottles in very cold water at first, as this may cause them to crack. [Illustration: Fig. 3] When the milk has been cooled by some rapid method, keep it cool until it is used. This precaution is necessary because of the nature of pasteurized milk. The temperature at which milk is pasteurized is sufficient to kill all fully developed bacteria, but those which exist in an undeveloped state, or in the form of spores, develop very rapidly after pasteurization unless the milk is kept cold and clean. If these bacteria were allowed to develop, the purpose of pasteurization would be lost, and the milk would become as dangerous as it was originally. The advantage of cooling milk rapidly will be fully appreciated upon referring to Fig. 4, which illustrates the development of a single germ in milk that is cooled rapidly and in milk that is cooled slowly. [Illustration: Fig. 4] 39. STERILIZED MILK.--By sterilized milk is meant milk in which all germs are destroyed by sterilization. Such milk is not sold by dealers, but the process of sterilization is resorted to in the home when pasteurization is not sufficient to render milk safe. This process, which is the only positive means of destroying all germs, consists in bringing the milk to the boiling point, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing it to boil for three quarters of an hour, and then cooling it rapidly. One who undertakes to treat milk in this way should remember that it is difficult to boil milk, because the solids in the milk adhere to the bottom and sides of the vessel and soon burn. However, this difficulty can be overcome by sterilizing the milk in the bottles in which it is bought. 40. To sterilize milk, place the sealed bottles on a wire rack or a perforated pie tin in a deep vessel, as for the pasteurizing of milk, and pour cold water into the vessel until it nearly covers the bottles. Then raise the temperature of the water quickly to the boiling point, and after it has begun to bubble, allow it to boil for three quarters of an hour. At the end of this time, cool the milk rapidly and then keep it cool until it is used. 41. Although milk thus treated becomes safe, sterilization changes its flavor and digestibility. If milk of this kind must be used, some raw food should be given with it. A diet composed entirely of cooked food is not so ideal as one in which some raw food is included, because raw foods contain substances that are essential to health. The change that takes place in the composition of milk that has been sterilized can be easily observed. Such milk on becoming sour does not coagulate as does pasteurized or raw milk, owing to the fact that the lime salts in the milk are so changed by the high temperature as to prevent the thickening process from taking place. Then, too, sterilized milk is not likely to become sour even after considerable time. Still, such milk is not safe to use except when it is fresh, for instead of fermenting in the usual way it putrefies and is liable to cause such a dangerous sickness as ptomaine poisoning. 42. MODIFIED MILK.--For infants who cannot be fed their normal diet, cow's milk must be used as a substitute, but in order to make it a more nearly ideal food for them it must usually be modified, or changed, by adding other materials. When it is so treated, it is known as modified milk. The materials used to modify milk are sterile water, lime water, barley water, cream, skim milk, milk sugar, or some other easily digested carbohydrate, one of these or a combination of them always being employed. The proportion of these ingredients to use varies with the age of the child that is to be fed and must be constantly changed to meet the child's requirements. In the production of modified milk, a physician's prescription and directions should always be followed closely. Only the best quality of milk should be used, and, in addition, the greatest care should be taken to have all the bottles, utensils, and materials used as clean and sterile as it is possible to make them. If such conditions cannot be met, it is advisable to pasteurize the modified-milk mixture after the materials have been put together. PRESERVED MILK 43. Besides milk that is commonly sold by dairymen and milk dealers, it is possible to buy in the market many grades of so-called PRESERVED MILK. Such milk is produced by driving off all or part of the water contained in milk, and it is sold as _condensed, evaporated,_ and _powdered milk_. Usually, it is put up in tin cans, and while it is not used so extensively as regular milk, many firms are engaged in its preparation. 44. CONDENSED AND EVAPORATED MILK.--As has just been mentioned, condensed and evaporated milk is produced by the complete or partial evaporation of the water contained in milk. Such milk can be shipped long distances or kept for long periods of time, because it does not contain sufficient moisture to permit the growth of bacteria. In evaporating milk to produce these preserved milks, each gallon is diminished in quantity to about two and one quarter pints, the original 87 per cent. of water being reduced to about 25 per cent. Therefore, in order to use such milk, sufficient water must be added to restore it to its original composition. Sometimes comparatively large amounts of cane sugar are added to such milks, which, besides sweetening them, assist in their preservation. If cane sugar is not used, the milks are usually made sterile in order to prevent them from spoiling. 45. POWDERED MILK.--The form of preserved milk known as powdered milk is the result of completely evaporating the water in milk. Such milk has the appearance of a dry powdered substance. It does not spoil easily and is so greatly reduced in quantity that it can be conveniently stored. Because of these characteristics, this product, for which skim milk is generally used, is extensively manufactured. It is used chiefly by bakers and confectioners, and, as in the case of evaporated or condensed milk, the water that has been evaporated in the powdering process must be supplied when the milk is used. STANDARD GRADING OF MILK AND CREAM 46. In order that a definite idea may be formed of the sanitary and bacteriological standards that are set by milk commissions, there are here given, in Table I, the regulations governing the grades and designation of milk and cream that may be sold in the city of New York. As will be observed from a study of this table, only definite grades of milk and cream can be sold in that city; likewise, it must conform to certain standards of purity and the producer must handle it in such a way that it may be delivered to the consumer in as clean and fresh a condition as possible. Without doubt, a grading similar to this one will become general throughout the United States eventually, for this is the only way by which the housewife may know with certainty whether or not the milk she purchases is of the right composition and is safe, fresh, and sanitary in every respect. The different qualities of milk and cream as shown by this grading are, of course, sold at different prices, those which require the greatest care and expense in handling selling for the highest price. MILK IN THE HOME PURCHASE OF MILK 47. After the housewife has become familiar with the points that she should know concerning milk, she will be much better equipped to purchase milk of the right kind for her home. However, there are still some points for her to observe when she is purchasing milk if she would supply her family with the best quality of this food. 48. In the first place, she should buy milk from a reliable dealer who will not object to questioning, and, if possible, she should make an investigation of the dairy that supplies the milk that she uses. If she cannot investigate the dairy personally, she should at least endeavor to obtain information from those who are prepared to give it. If she learns that the conditions in the dairy that is supplying her with milk are not what they should be, she should try to obtain milk from some other source. Of course, she should remember that milk of the best and cleanest quality is the highest in price, because of the increased cost of production; but it is usually advisable to pay the higher price, especially if children are to be fed, because cheap milk is liable to be unsafe, at least for any purpose that will require it to be served without cooking. Should the income not allow the best quality of milk to be used for all purposes, a cheaper grade can be used for cooking, but it is always economical to purchase the best quality when this food is to be used as a beverage. [Illustration: FIG. 5] 49. In the next place, the housewife should purchase milk from a dealer who delivers cold milk, because, as has been mentioned, bacteria multiply rapidly in warm milk. She should also try to obtain milk put up in bottles, for such milk has advantages over milk dipped from a can in that it does not have the same chance to become dirty and it affords a greater opportunity to secure accurate measurement. The kind of caps used on milk bottles should also be observed. Caps that have to be pried out with a knife or a similar utensil are not nearly so satisfactory as those shown in Fig. 5 (_a_), which have small tabs _a_ that permit the cap to be lifted out. In addition to the caps, which serve to keep dirt out of the milk and permit it to be delivered without being spilled, some dealers use covers like that shown in (_b_). Such covers are held in place by a wire and serve further to protect the milk from contamination. If milk purchased in bottles is clean, there should be no sediment in the bottom of the bottle after it has been allowed to stand for some time. Also, if it is fresh, it will not sour quickly after it is delivered, so that in case it is properly cared for and sours quickly, it may be known to be stale milk. However, if it does not sour in the normal length of time, it should be looked on with suspicion, for, as has been pointed out, such milk may have added to it a preservative to prevent souring. The housewife may expect milk that is delivered cold and is guaranteed to be sanitary and fresh to remain sweet at least 24 hours, provided, of course, it is placed in the refrigerator immediately upon delivery and kept there until used. * * * * * REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE GRADES AND DESIGNATION OF MILK AND CREAM WHICH MAY BE SOLD IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK The following classifications apply to milk and cream.

NECESSITY FOR CARE IN THE HOME.--If milk of good quality is bought, and, as has been suggested, this should be done whenever it is possible, the next thing to do is to care for it in such a way that it may be fed to the family in the same condition as it was when delivered. It is, of course, of prime importance that the dairyman deliver clean fresh milk, but this is not sufficient; the milk must remain in this condition until it is used, and this can occur only when the housewife knows how to care for it properly after it enters the home. It is possible to make safe milk unsafe and unsafe milk positively dangerous unless the housewife understands how to care for milk and puts into practice what she knows concerning this matter. Indeed, some of the blame laid to the careless handling of milk by dairymen really belongs to housewives, for very often they do not take care of milk in the right way after delivery. As too much attention cannot be given to this matter, explicit directions are here outlined, with the idea of assisting the housewife in this matter as much as possible. 51. KEEPING MILK CLEAN IN THE HOME.--Immediately upon delivery, the bottle containing the milk should be placed in the coolest place available, never being allowed to stand on the porch in the sun or where such animals as cats or dogs may come in contact with it. When the milk is to be used, the paper cap should be carefully wiped before it is removed from the bottle, so that any dirt that may be on top will not fall into the milk. If not all the milk is used and the bottle must be returned to the cool place where it is kept, it should be covered by means of an inverted drinking glass or, as shown in Fig. 6, by a glass or porcelain cover. Such covers, or _sanitary milk_ _caps_, as they are called, are very convenient for this purpose and may be purchased at a slight cost. 52. Another precaution that should be taken is never to mix stale milk with fresh milk, because the entire quantity will become sour in the same length of time as the stale milk would. Also, milk that has been poured into a pitcher or any other open vessel and allowed to stand exposed to the air for some time should never be put back into the bottle with the remaining milk. Such milk is sure to be contaminated with the germs that are always present in the dust constantly circulating in the air. It is sometimes necessary to keep milk in a vessel other than the bottle in which it is delivered. In such an event, the vessel that is used should be washed thoroughly, boiled in clean water, and cooled before the milk is poured into it. [Illustration: Fig. 6] 53. Particular care should be taken of the empty milk bottles. They should never be used for anything except milk. Before they are returned to the dairyman to be used again, they should first be rinsed with cold water, then washed thoroughly with hot, soapy water, and finally rinsed with hot water. If there is illness in the home, the washed bottles should be put into a pan of cool water, allowed to come to a boil, and permitted to boil for a few minutes. Such attention will free the bottles from any contamination they might have received. The dairyman, of course, gives the bottles further attention before he uses them again, but the housewife should do her part by making sure that they are thoroughly cleansed before they are collected by him. 54. KEEPING MILK COOL IN THE HOME.--As has been pointed out, milk should, upon being received, be kept in the coolest place available, which, in the majority of homes at the present time, is the refrigerator. In making use of the refrigerator for this purpose, the housewife should put into practice what she learned in _Essentials of Cookery_, Part 2, concerning the proper placing of food in the refrigerator, remembering that milk should be placed where it will remain the coolest and where it is least likely to absorb odors. She should also bear in mind that the temperature inside of a refrigerator varies with that of the surrounding air. It is because of this fact that milk often sours when the temperature is high, as in summer, for instance, even though it is kept in the refrigerator. 55. In case a refrigerator is not available, it will be necessary to resort to other means of keeping milk cool. A cool cellar or basement is an excellent substitute, but if milk is kept in either of these places, it must be tightly covered. Then, too, the spring house with its stream of running water is fully as good as a refrigerator And is used extensively in farming districts. But even though a housewife has none of these at her disposal, she need not be deprived of fresh milk, for there are still other ways of keeping milk cool and consequently fresh. A very simple way in which to keep milk cool is to weight down the bottles in a vessel that is deeper than they are and then pour cold water into the vessel until it reaches the top of the bottles, replacing the water occasionally as it becomes warm. A still better way, however, so far as convenience and results are concerned, is that illustrated in Fig. 7. As shown, wrap the bottle in a clean towel or piece of cotton cloth so that one corner of it is left loose at the top. Then place this end in a pan of cold water that stands higher than the bottle. Such an arrangement will keep the cloth wet constantly and by the evaporation of the water from it will cause the milk to remain cool. [Illustration: FIG. 7] COOKING MILK 56. POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING MILK.--Because of the nature of milk and its constituents, the cooking of this liquid is a little more difficult than would appear at first thought. In fact, heating milk to a temperature greater than 155 degrees Fahrenheit causes several changes to occur in it, one of which, the coagulation of the albumin, has already been mentioned. As the albumin hardens into the layer that forms on the top of boiled milk, a certain amount of fat, sugar, and casein becomes entangled in it, and if the coagulated skin is rejected, these food substances, in addition to the albumin, are lost. Another change that results from boiling is in the fat globules that remain, for these separate and exist no longer in the form of cream. 57. When milk that is not perfectly fresh is cooked with other materials or soups, sauces, and puddings it sometimes curdles. To prevent curdling, the milk should be heated as rapidly as possible before it is used with the other ingredients. While the separate heating of the milk involves a little more work, time may be gained by heating the milk while the remaining ingredients are being prepared. The curdling of comparatively fresh milk is often caused by the addition of salt, especially if the salt is added when the milk is hot. However, if a pinch of bicarbonate of soda is added to the milk before it is heated, it will not be likely to curdle even though it is not absolutely fresh. When tomato is to be used in soup that contains milk or cream, curdling can be prevented if the milk or the cream to be used is thickened with flour or corn starch or a little soda is added to the tomato before the two are mixed. The mixing is accomplished by pouring the _tomato into the milk_ instead of the milk into the tomato. When acid fruit juices are to be added to milk or cream and the mixture then frozen, curdling can be prevented by thoroughly chilling the milk or cream in the freezer can before combining it with the juices. 58. As has already been learned, great care must be taken in the heating of milk, because the solids that it contains adhere quickly to the bottom of the pan and cause the milk to scorch. For this reason, milk should never be heated directly over the flame unless the intention is to boil it, and even if it must be boiled every precaution should be taken to prevent it from burning. It should be remembered, too, that a very small scorched area will be sufficient to make a quantity of milk taste burned. The utensil in which milk can be heated in the most satisfactory way is the double boiler, for the milk does not come in direct contact with the heat in this utensil. If a double boiler is not available, good results can be obtained by setting one pan into another that contains water. 59. Milk is often used in place of water for cooking cereals, beverages, puddings, soups, etc. This is good practice and should be followed whenever possible, for when milk is added it serves to increase the nutritive value of the food. It should be observed, however, that more time is required to cook grains or cereals in milk than to cook them in water, because milk contains more solid matter than water and is not absorbed so quickly. Another frequent use of milk is in breads and biscuits, where, as is explained in _Bread_ and _Hot Breads_, it produces a browner and more tender crust than water. 60. VARIETY OF WAYS TO USE MILK IN COOKING.--Because of the numerous purposes for which milk is required in the preparation of foods, the smallest amount of it, whether sweet or sour, can be utilized in cooking; therefore, no milk need ever be wasted. A few of the uses to which this food is oftenest put are mentioned briefly in order that the housewife may be familiar enough with them to call them to mind whenever she desires to carry out a recipe that calls for milk or when she has occasion to utilize milk that she has on hand. Milk thickened slightly with flour and flavored with such material as corn, asparagus, celery, tomatoes, beans, peas, or fish makes a delicious soup. In bisques, or thickened soups, and in chowders, the liquid used need not be milk, but these are made very appetizing if milk is used for part or all of the liquid. Then, too, sauces or gravies made with milk, thickened with flour, and made rich with butter or other fat lend themselves to a variety of uses. Dice of vegetables, meat, fish, or game added to a sauce of this kind and served in pastry cases or over toast provide dishes that are delightful additions to any meal. Milk is also used as the basis for custards, blanc manges, ices, sherbets, ice creams, and tapioca, rice, and bread puddings in which eggs, starchy materials, and flavorings are added and the mixture then baked, steamed, boiled, or frozen, as the desired result may require. As is well known, milk is practically indispensable in the making of cakes, cookies, quick breads, and in fact nearly all dough mixtures. Even if it has soured, it can be used with soda to take the place of cream of tartar in mixtures that are to be made light, the lactic acid in the sour milk acting with the soda as leavening. Left-over milk in comparatively large quantities may also be used in the home for the making of cheese, although this product of milk is usually produced commercially. RECIPES FOR MILK DISHES AND SAUCES FOODS CONTAINING MILK 61. From the discussion given up to this point, it will be noted that milk is used in a large variety of ways and in the making of numerous dishes. However, most of the dishes in which this liquid occurs involve other important materials, so that the recipes for them are usually listed under some other ingredient or division of cookery. For instance, milk is used in the making of ice cream, but as the ice creams are included among cold desserts, recipes for them would naturally come in the Section pertaining to this subject. Milk is also an important ingredient in puddings, but the recipes for such dishes are given in the Section in which puddings and their sauces are discussed. Because of this fact, there are only a few recipes that have milk as their basis, and this accounts for the small number of recipes here given. Chief among the recipes that involve principally milk are those for junket and white sauce, and while the number of these is small and the use of the dishes not so general as some kinds of food, just as much attention should be given to them as if they occurred in greater numbers and were used more commonly. Junket is very easily made and should therefore cause the housewife no concern; likewise, little difficulty will be experienced if the directions here given for white sauces are followed explicitly. RECIPES FOR JUNKET 62. Plain Junket.--In the stomachs of all animals that use milk as food is found a digestive ferment known as _rennin_. This is taken from the stomachs of calves, made up commercially, and sold in the form of tablets called _junket_. When these tablets are used properly with milk, they coagulate the milk and make an excellent dessert that resembles custard and that is very easy to digest. Because of its nature and qualities, this kind of dessert is used largely for invalids and children. The following recipe gives the proportion and directions for making this dessert in its simplest form. PLAIN JUNKET (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1 junket tablet 1 Tb. cold water 1 qt. milk 4 Tb. sugar 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. vanilla or other flavoring Dissolve the junket tablet in the cold water. Warm the milk very slowly to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, testing the temperature to make sure that it is right. If a thermometer is not on hand, this can be done by dropping a drop on the back of the hand. When neither heat nor cold can be felt from this drop of milk, it may be known to be very near the body temperature, the temperature at which rennin is active. If temperature is found to be too high, the milk must be cooled before the tablet is added. When the desired temperature has been reached, add the sugar, the alt, the junket dissolved in the water, and the flavoring. Then pour all into individual molds and keep it where it will remain warm for about 10 minutes, at the end of which it should be firm like a custard and may be cooled. Keep the junket cool until it is to be served, when it may be turned out of the mold or served in it. As junket will turn to whey if it is broken with a spoon to any extent, serving it in the mold is the better plan. [Illustration: FIG. 8] 63. Junket With. Fruit.--The addition of fruit to junket, as in the dish illustrated in Fig. 8, makes an attractive dessert for both sick and well people. If the fruit used is permissible in the diet of an invalid, its combination with junket adds variety to the diet. In the making of this dessert, all juice should be carefully drained from the fruit before the junket is poured over it. Canned or fresh fruits may be used with equally good results. JUNKET WITH FRUIT (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1 junket tablet 1 Tb. cold water 1 qt. milk 1/4 c. sugar 1/4 tsp. salt Flavoring 8 halves of canned peaches or 1 c. of berries or small fruit Make a junket as directed in the preceding recipe. Drain all juice from the fruit and place a half peach or a spoonful of fruit in the bottom of each of the eight molds and pour the junket over it to fill the mold. Let it solidify and serve cold. 64. CHOCOLATE JUNKET.--Chocolate added to plain junket not only varies the junket dessert, but also adds food value, since chocolate contains a large quantity of fat that is easily digested by most persons. Where the flavor of chocolate is found agreeable, such junket may be served in place of the plain junket. CHOCOLATE JUNKET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. milk 2 sq. chocolate 6 Tb. sugar 3/4 c. water 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. vanilla 1 junket tablet Heat the milk to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, testing in the manner explained in Art. 62. Melt the chocolate in a saucepan, add to it the sugar and 1 cupful of water, and cook until smooth; then cool and add to the warm milk, putting in the salt, vanilla, and junket tablet dissolved in cupful of the water. Turn the junket into a dish or into molds and let stand in a warm place until set; then chill and serve. In preparing this recipe, it will be well to note that if sweet chocolate is used less sugar than is specified may be employed. 65. CARAMEL JUNKET.--In the making of caramel junket, browned, or caramelized, sugar and water take the place of part of the milk, and while a certain amount of the sugar is reduced in the browning, the caramel is still very high in food value and adds nutritive material to the dessert. There is nothing about caramel junket to prevent its being given to any one able to take plain junket, and if it is made correctly it has a very delightful flavor. CARAMEL JUNKET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. milk 1/2 c. sugar 1/2 c. boiling water 1/4 tsp. salt 1 tsp. vanilla 1 junket tablet Whipped cream 1/4 c. chopped nuts Heat the milk to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Caramelize the sugar by melting it in a saucepan directly over the flame until it is a light-brown color; then stir in the boiling water and cook until the caramel and the water become a sirup, after which cool and add to the milk Add the salt, the vanilla, and the junket tablet dissolved in a tablespoonful of cold water Pour the mixture into a dish, let it stand in a warm place until it sets; then chill, cover with sweetened whipped cream, sprinkle with chopped nuts, and serve. RECIPES FOR WHITE SAUCE 66. Three white sauces are commonly used for different purposes, and in each one of them milk is the basis. These sauces differ from one another in thickness, and include _thin white sauce_, which is used for cream toast and soups; _medium white sauce_, which is used for dressing vegetables and is flavored in various ways to accompany meats, patties, or croquettes; and _thick white sauce_, which is used to mix with the materials used for croquettes in order to hold them together. To insure the best results, the proportion of flour and liquid should be learned for each kind, and to avoid the formation of lumps the proper method of mixing should be carefully followed out. A white sauce properly made is perfectly smooth, and since only little care is needed to produce such a result it is inexcusable to serve a lumpy sauce. Also, nothing is more disagreeable than thick, pasty sauce, but this can be avoided by employing the right proportion of flour and milk. The ingredients and their proportions for the various kinds of white sauce are as follows: THIN WHITE SAUCE 1 c. milk 1 Tb. butter 1 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt MEDIUM WHITE SAUCE 1 c. milk 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt THICK WHITE SAUCE 1 c. milk 2 Tb. butter 1/4 c. (4 Tb.) flour 1/2 tsp. salt It will be easy to remember the proportions for these three sauces if it is observed that each one doubles the previous one in the quantity of flour used, the thin one having 1 tablespoonful to 1 cupful of milk, the medium one 2 tablespoonfuls to 1 cupful of milk, and the thick one 4 tablespoonfuls to 1 cupful of milk. To produce these sauces the ingredients may be combined in three different ways, each of which has its advantages. These methods, which are here given, should be carefully observed, for they apply not only to the making of this particular sauce, but to the combining of fat, starch, and liquid in any sauce. _Method 1_.--Heat the milk, being careful that it does not scorch. Brown the butter slightly in a saucepan, add the flour and salt, and stir the mixture until it is perfectly smooth and has a deep cream color. Then add the hot milk gradually, stirring to prevent the formation of lumps. Cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the sauce from scorching. Sauce made according to this method does not require long cooking because the flour added to the hot fat cooks quickly. In fact, it is a very desirable method, for the browned butter and the flour lend flavor to the sauce. Many otherwise unattractive or rather tasteless foods can be made much more appetizing by the addition of white sauce made in this way. _Method 2_.--Put the milk on to heat. While this is heating, stir the butter, flour, and salt together until they are soft and well mixed; then add the hot milk to them slowly, stirring constantly. Place over the heat and finish cooking, or cook in a double boiler. Sauce made by this method requires longer cooking than the preceding one and it has less flavor. _Method 3_.--Heat the milk, reserving a small portion. Stir the flour smooth with the cold milk and add it to the hot milk, stirring rapidly. Add the butter and the salt, and continue to stir if cooked over the heat; if cooked in a double boiler, stir only until the mixture is completely thickened and then continue to cook for 10 or 15 minutes. When butter is added to the mixture in this way, it is likely to float on top, especially if too much is used. A better sauce may be made according to this method by using thin cream for the liquid and omitting the butter.

BUTTER is the fatty constituent of milk. It is obtained by skimming or separating the cream from milk and churning it in order to make the particles of fat adhere to one another. Butter is used largely in the household as an article of food, for it is one of the most appetizing and digestible forms of fat. To supply the demand for butter, it is produced domestically in the home and on farms and commercially in dairies and large establishments. The principle of all churns used for butter making is practically the same. They simply agitate the cream so that the butter-fat globules in it are brought together in masses of such size as to enable the butter maker to separate them from the buttermilk. Butter is seasoned, or salted, to give it a desirable flavor and to improve its keeping qualities; it is washed, or worked, in order to distribute the salt evenly, to separate from it as much of the curd and other non-fatty constituents of the cream as can be conveniently removed, to bring it into a compact, waxy mass, and to give it texture. The United States authorities have set a standard for the composition of butter, which allows this product to contain not more than 16 per cent. of water and requires it to have at least 82.5 per cent. of butter fat. 2. ECONOMICAL USE OF BUTTER.--In the home, butter is used on the table and in the cooking of many foods. Hardly any article of food has such general use as this one; in fact, a meal is usually considered to be incomplete without it, both as an accompaniment to bread, rolls, biscuits, or whatever variety of these is used, and as an ingredient in the cooking of some foods that require fat. But butter is not cheap, so that the wise and economical use of this food in the home is a point that should not be overlooked by the housewife. This precaution is very important, it having been determined that butter, as well as other fats, is wasted to a great extent; and still it is true that no other material can be so economically utilized. The very smallest amount of any kind of fat should be carefully saved, for there are numerous uses to which it can be put. Even though it is mixed with other food, it can always be melted out, clarified--that is, freed from foreign substances--and then used for some purpose in cooking. The chief way in which butter is wasted is in the unnecessary and improper use of it, points that a little careful thought will do much to remedy. 3. FLAVOR AND COMPOSITION OF BUTTER.--That the housewife may have an understanding of the food substances found in butter and also learn how to determine the quantity of butter needed for her family, she should become familiar with the composition of this food. The flavor of butter depends to a great extent on the kind of cream from which it is made, both sweet and sour cream being used for this purpose. Of these two kinds, sour cream is the preferable one, because it gives to the butter a desirable flavor. Still, the unsalted butter that is made from sweet cream is apparently growing in favor, although it is usually more expensive than salted butter. The difference in price is due to the fact that unsalted butter spoils readily. 4. So far as its food substances are concerned, butter is composed largely of fat, but it also contains water, protein in the form of casein, and mineral matter. The quantity of water contained in butter determines to a large extent the weight of butter, since water is heavier than fat; but as only 16 per cent, of water is allowed, butter that contains more water than this is considered to be adulterated. As very little milk is retained in butter, only a small percentage of protein is found in this food. However, a considerable quantity of mineral salts are present, and these make it more valuable than most of the other fats. Because of the nature of its composition--a very high percentage of fat and a low percentage of protein--butter is distinctly a fuel food, that is, a heat-producing food. Of course, there are cheaper fats, some of which are even better heat-producing foods than butter, but as their flavor is not especially agreeable to some persons, they are not used so extensively. In view of the nature of the composition of this food, an ounce of butter a day is the average allowance for each person when the diet of a family contains meat and such other fats as lard, olive oil, etc. At the most, 1/2 pound of butter should be purchased each week for each member of the family for table use, and fats cheaper than butter should be used for cooking purposes. 5. PURCHASING BUTTER.--As in the case of milk, in order that the housewife may judge the quality of the butter she purchases, she will do well to look into the cleanliness and sanitary condition of the dairy that produces it. Too much attention cannot be given to this matter, for if cream becomes contaminated from careless handling, the same contamination is liable to occur in the butter made from it. Butter that is produced in dairies that make large quantities of it usually has not much opportunity to become contaminated before it reaches the consumer, for it is generally pressed into 1-pound prints, and each one of these is then wrapped and placed in a paper carton. On the other hand, the farmer and the dairyman doing a small business do not find it profitable to install the equipment required to put up butter in this way, so they usually pack their butter into firkins or crocks or make it into rolls. When such butter goes to market, it is generally placed in a refrigerator with more butter of the same sort, some of which is good and some bad. As butter absorbs any strong odor present in the refrigerator and is perhaps cut and weighed in a most unsanitary manner, the good becomes contaminated with the bad. While butter of this kind is perhaps a few cents cheaper than that which is handled in a more sanitary way, it is less desirable, and if possible should be avoided by the housewife. In case butter is obtained from a certain farm, the conditions on that farm should be looked into for the same reason that the conditions in a dairy are investigated. 6. To be able to select good butter, the housewife should also be familiar with its characteristics. In color, butter to be good should be an even yellow, neither too pale nor too bright, and should contain no streaks. The light streaks that are sometimes found in butter indicate insufficient working. As to odor, butter should be pleasing and appetizing, any foreign or strong, disagreeable odor being extremely objectionable. Stale butter or that which is improperly kept develops an acid called _butyric acid_, which gives a disagreeable odor and flavor to butter and often renders it unfit for use. 7. CARE OF BUTTER.--The precautions that the farmer and dairyman are called on to observe in the making and handling of butter should be continued by the housewife after she purchases butter for home use. The chief point for her to remember is that butter should be kept as cold as possible, because a low temperature prevents it from spoiling, whereas a high one causes it to become soft and less appetizing. The most satisfactory place in which to keep butter is the refrigerator, where it should be placed in the compartment located directly under the ice and in which the milk is kept, for here it will not come in contact with foods that might impart their flavors to it. Should no refrigerator be available, some other means of keeping butter cold must be resorted to, such as a cool cellar or basement or a window box. The way in which butter is bought determines to a certain extent the method of caring for it. If it is bought in paper cartons, it should be rewrapped and replaced in the carton each time some is cut off for use. In case it is bought in bulk, it should never be allowed to remain in the wooden dish in which it is often sold; rather, it should be put into a crock or a jar that can be tightly covered. 8. Attention should also be given to butter that is cut from the supply for the table or for cooking purposes and that is not entirely used. Such butter should never be returned to the original supply, but should be kept in a separate receptacle and used for cooking. If it contains foreign material, it can be clarified by allowing it to stand after it has melted until this has settled and then dipping or pouring the clear fat from the top. Butter that has become rancid or has developed a bad flavor need not be wasted either, for it can be made ready for use in cooking simply by pouring boiling water over it, allowing it to cool, and then removing the layer of fat that comes to the top. Such butter, of course, cannot be used for serving on the table. Still, consideration on the part of the housewife to just such matters as these will prevent much of the waste that prevails in the household in the use of this food. 9. COOKING WITH BUTTER.--While some housewives make it a practice to use butter in cooking of all kinds, there are uses in which other fats are preferable; or, in case butter is desired, there are certain points to be observed in its use. For instance, butter is rendered less digestible by cooking it at a high temperature, as in frying or saut\\u00e9ing; also, it cannot be used to any extent for the frying of foods, as it burns very readily. If it is used for saut\\u00e9ing, the dish is made much more expensive than is necessary, so that in most cases a cheaper fat should be employed for this purpose. In addition, a point to remember is that this fat should not be used to grease the pans in which cakes and hot breads are baked unless it is first melted, because the milk contained in the butter burns easily; after it is melted, only the top fat should be used. When butter is desired for very rich cakes and for pastry, it is usually washed in cold water to remove the milk. To neutralize the sour milk contained in butter that is used for baking purposes, a little soda is sometimes employed. Further economy can be exercised in the use of butter if a little thought is given to the matter. For instance, when butter is melted and poured over meat or fish that has been broiled or over vegetables that have been cooked in a plain way, much of it usually remains in the dish and is wasted. Such butter can be utilized again. Since butter undergoes a change when it is cooked, it should be mixed with cooked foods to flavor them, rather than be subjected to the temperature necessary for cooking. When butter is used for spreading sandwiches, it usually will be found advisable to soften the butter by creaming it with a spoon, but it should never be melted for this purpose. 10. SERVING BUTTER.--When butter is used for the table, some consideration must be given to the serving of it. Probably the most usual way of serving butter is to place a slice of it on a plate and then pass the plate with a knife to each person at the table. The advantage of this method is that each person can take the amount desired and thus prevent waste. However, a still more desirable way of serving butter that is to be passed is to cut it into small cubes or squares or to shape it into small balls and then serve it with a fork or a butter knife. To prevent the pieces or balls of butter from melting in warm weather, cracked ice may be placed on the butter dish with them. Butter cut into cubes or squares may also be served on an individual butter dish or an individual bread-and-butter plate placed at each person's place before the meal is served. Whichever plan is adopted, any fragments of butter that remain on the plates after a meal should be gathered up and used for cooking purposes. [Illustration: FIG 1] 11. Butter that comes in pound prints lends itself readily to the cutting of small cubes or squares for serving. Such butter may be cut by drawing a string through the print or by using a knife whose cutting edge is covered with paper, a small piece of the oiled paper such as that in which the butter is wrapped answering very well for this purpose. If butter balls are desired for serving, they may be rolled with butter paddles in the manner shown in Fig. 1. To make butter balls, put wads of the butter to be used into ice water so as to make them hard. Then place each wad between the paddles, as shown, and give the paddles a circular motion. After a little practice, it will be a simple matter to make butter balls that will add to the attractiveness of any meal. Paddles made especially for this purpose can be purchased in all stores that sell kitchen utensils. [Illustration: FIG. 2] 12. Sometimes, for practical purposes, it is desired to know the quantity of butter that is served to each person. In the case of print butter, this is a simple matter to determine. As shown in Fig. 2, first mark the pound print in the center in order to divide it in half; after cutting it into two pieces, cut each half into two, and finally each fourth into two. With the pound print cut into eight pieces, divide and cut each eighth into four pieces. As there will be thirty-two small pieces, each one will represent one thirty-second of a pound, or 1/2 ounce. BUTTER SUBSTITUTES 13. In about the year 1870, through a desire to procure a cheaper article than butter for the poorer classes of France, came the manufacture of the first substitute for butter. Since that time the use of butter substitutes has gradually increased, until at the present time millions of pounds are consumed every year. A certain amount of prejudice against their use exists, but much of this is unnecessary for they are less likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria than the poorer qualities of butter. Then, too, they do not spoil so readily, and for this reason they can be handled with greater convenience than butter. 14. OLEOMARGARINE.--The best substitute for butter and the one most largely used is called oleomargarine, which in the United States alone constitutes about two and 1/2 per cent. of all the fat used as butter. This fat is called by various other names, such as _margarine,_ and _butterine_, but oleomargarine is the name by which the United States authorities recognize the product. It is made by churning fats other than butter fat with milk or cream until a butterlike consistency is obtained. Originally, pure beef fat was employed for this purpose, and while beef fat is used to a great extent at present, lard, cottonseed oil, coconut oil, and peanut oil are also used. Whatever fats are selected are churned with milk, cream, and, for the finest grades, a considerable percentage of the very best pure butter. After they are churned, the oleomargarine is worked, salted, and packed in the same manner as butter. 15. The manufacture and sale of butter substitutes are controlled by laws that, while they do not specify the kind of fat to be used, state that all mixtures of butter with other fats must be sold as oleomargarine. They also require that a tax of 10 cents a pound be paid on all artificially colored oleomargarine; therefore, while coloring matter is used in some cases, this product is usually sold without coloring. In such an event, coloring matter is given with each pound of oleomargarine that is sold. Before using the oleomargarine, this coloring matter is simply worked into the fat until it is evenly colored. 16. RENOVATED BUTTER.--Another substitute that is sometimes used to take the place of the best grades of butter is renovated, or process, butter. This is obtained by purifying butter that is dirty and rancid and that contains all sorts of foreign material and then rechurning it with fresh cream or milk. The purifying process consists in melting the butter, removing the scum from the top, as well as the buttermilk, brine, and foreign materials that settle, and then blowing air through the fat to remove any odors that it might contain. Butter that is thus purified is replaced on the market, but in some states the authorities have seen fit to restrict its sale. While such restrictions are without doubt justifiable, it is possible to buy butter that is more objectionable than renovated, or process, butter, but that has no restriction on it. 17. METHOD OF TESTING BUTTER SUBSTITUTES.--Very often oleomargarine and process butter bear such a close resemblance to genuine butter that it is almost impossible to detect the difference. However, there is a simple test by which these substitutes can always be distinguished from butter, and this should be applied whenever there is any doubt about the matter. To make this test, place the fat in a tablespoon or a small dish and heat it directly over the flame until it boils, stirring it occasionally to assist in the melting. If it is oleomargarine or process butter, it will sputter noisily and take on a curdled appearance; whereas, if it is butter, it will melt and even boil without sputtering although it foams to a certain extent. * * * * * CHEESE CHARACTERISTICS AND CARE OF CHEESE 18. ORIGIN, PRODUCTION, AND USE OF CHEESE.--Cheese is a product that is manufactured from the solids of milk, and it provides a valuable food. The making of cheese was known in ancient times, it having probably originated through a desire to utilize an oversupply of milk. When cheese was first made, the fact that bacteria were present was not known, nor were the reasons for the spoiling of milk understood; but it was learned that milk can be kept if most of its water is removed. This discovery was very important, for it led to various methods of making cheese and proved that cheese making was a satisfactory and convenient means of storing nourishment in a form that was not bulky and that would keep for long periods of time. From a very small beginning, the different methods of making cheese became popular, until at the present time more than three hundred varieties are made and their manufacture forms one of the large industries of the world. In the United States, nearly all the cheese used up to about 50 years ago was made on farms, and to a great extent by housewives, but about that time a factory for the making of this product was started in the state of New York, and it proved a profitable enterprise. From this beginning, the business of making cheese commercially in this country has grown until now cheese is almost entirely a factory-made product, in the manufacture of which the states of New York and Wisconsin lead. 19. In either the commercial or the home production of cheese, skim milk with all or part of the cream removed is used for some varieties, while whole milk is used for others, the composition depending largely on the kind of milk that is employed. Rennet is added to the milk to coagulate it, and then the curd, from which nearly all the water is removed, is allowed to ripen. To produce characteristic odors, flavors, and consistency, various coloring and flavoring materials, as well as bacteria, are added to the curd. The action of these bacteria is really the chief factor in the making of cheese and they are therefore not only desirable but necessary. Non-desirable bacteria, however, result in the formation of bad odors, flavors, and gases in the finished product and these must be carefully guarded against by cheese makers. [Illustration: Fig. 3] 20. Cheese offers a valuable source of nutriment for the body, because its food value ranks high. As is shown in Fig. 3, the food value in 1 pound of cheese is equivalent to that in 2 pounds of beef, that in 24 eggs, or that in 4 pounds of fish. The use of cheese, however, is not nearly so great as its food value warrants, the amount used in the United States per capita being only about 3-1/2 pounds annually. This is a condition that should be overcome, for there is a large variety of ways in which cheese can be used to advantage in the diet. When eaten raw, it is very appetizing, and when used with soups, sauces, and foods that have a bland taste, it lends additional flavor and makes an especially attractive dish. In addition, the fact that it is an economical food and can be conveniently kept and stored should recommend its frequent use. 21. COMPOSITION OF CHEESE.--Since cheese is a product of milk, it is somewhat similar to milk in composition, but the change that occurs in the formation of cheese causes some differences. Nearly all the water present in milk is removed during the manufacture of cheese, so that this product becomes a concentrated food made up of all the nourishment that milk contains except small amounts of albumin, milk sugar, and mineral matter. These, because they are in solution in the water, are lost when the whey is separated from the curd. The food substances that occur in the largest amounts are fat and protein in the form of casein, which is the tissue-building material of milk. Cheese made from milk that contains some cream has in it a greater amount of fat than that made from completely skimmed milk. Besides these two chief food substances, cheese contains a small amount of milk sugar, mineral matter, and water. 22. On account of the large quantity of protein found in cheese, this food can readily take the place of meat in the diet; in fact, it has some decided advantages over meat. As has been pointed out, cheese yields more than twice as much food value as an equal weight of beef. Then, too, the buying and care of cheese are much simpler matters than the buying and care of meat. As it does not require the low temperature that meat requires and does not spoil so readily, it can be bought in considerable quantity and used as desired without danger of spoiling and loss. In addition, the use of cheese as food does not require so much skill in preparation as meat does, nor is there loss of flavor and nutriment in its preparation, as is often the case with meat. 23. QUALITY OF CHEESE.--Every variety of cheese has its own standard and quality, some being hard and dry, others moist, and still others very soft. The difference in quality is due to the way in which the curd is coagulated, the amount of pressure that is put on it, and the ripening of the cheese. The holes that often occur in cheese and give it a porous appearance are formed by gas, which is the product of the growth of bacteria. A large number of very small holes in cheese indicate that the milk used to make it was not clean and contained many kinds of bacteria. This condition could be overcome by the use of absolutely clean milk; indeed, milk of this kind is as necessary for the production of good cheese as it is for the making of good butter. Certain cheeses, such as Limburger and Roquefort, have a typical odor and flavor, the odor being due to bacteria and the flavor to mold. These are carefully grown and introduced into the cheese during its manufacture. 24. CARE OF CHEESE.--The very strong odor and flavor that characterize cheese make it necessary that care be given to cheese in the home in order to prevent it from coming in contact with other foods and transmitting its odor and flavor to them. The best place to keep cheese, particularly the soft varieties, is in the refrigerator, where it should be placed in a closed receptacle and kept as far as possible from foods that are easily tainted. It is well to avoid a damp place for the keeping of cheese, as mold frequently develops on the outside when too much moisture is present; but in case mold does appear it can be removed by cutting a thin slice from the side on which it has grown. On the other hand, cheese that is kept in a dry place becomes hard and dry unless it is wrapped in oiled paper or a damp cloth. However, such cheese need not be thrown away, for there are numerous uses, particularly in cooking, to which it can be put. * * * * * KINDS OF CHEESE CLASSIFICATION OF VARIETIES 25. The cheese used in the United States may be included under two leading classes, namely, _foreign cheese_ and _domestic cheese_. Since the foreign cheeses are imported, they are more expensive than the cheeses made here, and should not be bought if cheese is to be used as an economical article of food. They are valuable chiefly for their flavor and are generally bought for this reason. The domestic cheeses can be used in larger quantities, for, besides being less expensive, they are usually of a milder type and are more easily digested. To enable the housewife to become familiar with the principal varieties of each of these classes, a discussion of them, including their names, characteristics, and, in some cases, their use and the method of making, is here given. In addition, there are shown in colors, in Fig. 4, a large number of cheeses, together with a print of butter _o_, which serves to illustrate the irregular surface that is exposed when good butter is broken apart. IMPORTED CHEESE 26. Each of the European countries has originated its own peculiar kind of cheese, which remains representative of a certain people or locality. The majority of these cheeses have met with so much favor in the United States that large quantities of them are continually imported. A few of them have been copied here with success, but others have not been successfully made. While these are not in such common use as the domestic cheeses, it is well for every one to know their names and the characteristics by which they can be identified. 27. ENGLISH CHEESE.--Chief among the kinds of cheeses made in England is CHEDDAR CHEESE, which is illustrated at _a_, Fig. 4. It is rich, double-thick cream cheese, ranging from a pale to a dark yellow, although when uncolored it may be white. Such cheese, when fresh, has a milk flavor, but when it is well ripened it has a characteristic sharp taste. New Cheddar cheese is soft, but not waxy, in texture and may readily be shaved or broken into small pieces; when it is well ripened, it may be grated. English Cheddar cheese is not unlike AMERICAN CHEDDAR CHEESE, or, as it is commonly called, _American cream cheese_, which is shown by _b_. In fact the American variety is made according to the method used for the English. Owing to its characteristics, flavor, and abundance, Cheddar cheese, both English and American, is the kind that is used most extensively in the United States. ENGLISH DAIRY CHEESE, shown at _d_, is similar to Cheddar cheese, although it has a reddish color and, on account of the method of manufacture, it is harder. This kind of cheese lends itself well to cooking, as it may be easily grated. CHESHIRE CHEESE, a well-known English variety, is a dry cream cheese made from whole cow's milk. It is deep yellow or red in color, similar in flavor to Cheddar cheese, and is used in much the same manner. [Illustration] [Illustration] STILTON CHEESE, shown at _m_, is a hard cheese made from cow's milk to which cream has been added and which is coagulated with rennet. Mold is introduced into this cheese, so that it resembles Roquefort cheese, which is shown at _j_. 28. HOLLAND CHEESE.--The variety of cheese shown at _e_, Fig. 4, is known as EDAM CHEESE. It is a hard rennet cheese of a red color and is mild in flavor. This kind of cheese is molded into the shape of a ball, the outside of which is usually dyed red, and will keep for a long period of time. Edam cheese is one of the important products of the Netherlands, and while it is seldom used in cookery in the homes of this country, it is served at the table. Usually a section of the top is cut off to serve as a lid while the inside is scooped out as needed. Sometimes, after most of the cheese has been removed, the hollow shell is stuffed with macaroni or rice that has been cooked and seasoned and the food then baked in the shell. 29. FRENCH CHEESES.--Among the French cheeses, the variety called GRUY\\u00c8RE CHEESE, which is shown at _f_, Fig. 4, is well liked. It is usually made of skim milk, has a yellow color and a mild, sweetish flavor, and contains large holes like those found in Swiss and Emmenthal cheeses, varieties that are very similar to it. Like these cheeses, Gruy\\u00e8re cheese may be used in cooking or served without cooking, being used considerably in the making of sandwiches. BRIE CHEESE is a French variety of very soft cheese, with a strong flavor and odor. It is made from whole or partly skimmed cow's milk coagulated by means of rennet. This kind of cheese is used mostly as an accompaniment to other foods. CAMEMBERT CHEESE, which is shown at _h_, is also a soft cheese. It is made by practically the same process as Brie cheese and is used in the same way. This cheese has a typical odor. Its rind is thick and dry, but its center is very soft, being sometimes almost liquid. NEUFCH\\u00c2TEL CHEESE, which is shown at _i_, is a soft rennet cheese made from cow's milk. It is made at Neufch\\u00e2tel-en-Bray, France, and not at Neufch\\u00e2tel, Switzerland. This variety of cheese is wrapped in tin-foil and sold in small packages. It is used chiefly for salads, sandwiches, etc. As it does not keep well after the package is opened, the entire contents should be used at one time. ROQUEFORT CHEESE, which is shown at _j_, is a hard, highly flavored cheese made from sheep's milk coagulated with rennet. It has a marbled appearance, which is due to a greenish mold that is introduced. Roquefort cheese is frequently served with crackers at the end of a meal, and is well liked by many persons. 30. ITALIAN CHEESES.--From Italy is imported a cheese, called PARMESAN CHEESE, that is used extensively for flavoring soups and macaroni dishes. This cheese, which is shown at _g_, Fig. 4, is very hard and granular and, provided it is well made, it will keep for years. Owing to its characteristics, it may be easily grated. It can be bought by the pound and grated as it is needed, or it can be secured already grated in bottles. GORGONZOLA, another Italian cheese, is shown at _k_. It is not unlike Roquefort in appearance and in use, but it is made from whole cow's milk coagulated with rennet. Into this cheese is also introduced a mold that gives its center a streaked or mottled appearance. 31. SWISS CHEESES.--Possibly the best known cheese imported from Switzerland is the variety known as SWISS, or SWITZER, CHEESE. This kind of cheese has different names, depending on the district of Switzerland in which it is made. Nevertheless all of them are similar and have a mild, sweet flavor. Swiss cheese may be readily recognized by its pale yellow color and the presence of large holes, although it resembles Gruy\\u00e8re cheese very closely. EMMENTHAL CHEESE is a variety of fairly hard cheese that originated in Switzerland, but is now made in many other countries. It is similar to Swiss cheese, being made from whole cow's milk and characterized by large holes about 3 inches apart. SAPSAGO CHEESE, shown at _n_, Fig. 4, is a skim-milk cheese made in Switzerland. It is a very hard cheese, and therefore suitable for grating. In the process of making this cheese, melilot, a clover-like herb, is added, and this gives the cheese a green color and a peculiar flavor. 32. BELGIAN CHEESE.--A cheese that originated in Belgium, but is now manufactured in other countries, is the variety known as LIMBURG, or LIMBURGER, CHEESE, cheese, which is shown at _l_, Fig. 4. It is a soft rennet cheese made from whole cow's milk. It is very strong in taste and smell, due to putrefactive germs that are added to the milk in its manufacture. DOMESTIC CHEESE 33. In the United States, efforts that have been exerted to make cheeses similar to some of those produced in Europe have to a certain extent been successful. American cheese makers have succeeded in making several soft cream cheeses that resemble Neufch\\u00e2tel, some of which are spiced or flavored with pimiento, olives, etc. In addition, Limburg and Swiss cheeses have been successfully manufactured in Wisconsin, and Brie, Neufch\\u00e2tel, and Camembert have been copied and are produced in New York. Pineapple cheese, while of American origin, is really very much like English Cheddar cheese, except that it is harder. But while these fancy cheeses are desired by some persons and have a moderately large sale, the cheese for which there is the most demand in America is the so-called American Cheddar cheese, which, as has been stated, is made according to the method used for English Cheddar cheese. 34. AMERICAN CHEDDAR CHEESE.--Since American Cheddar cheese is the kind that is commonly used in this country, the way in which it is made will be well to know. The milk used for this kind of cheese is first inspected as to cleanliness and the extent of fermentation it has undergone, and when these points are ascertained, it is _ripened_; that is, allowed to sour to a certain degree of acidity. At this stage, coloring matter is added, after which the milk is prepared for setting by bringing it to a certain temperature. With the temperature at the right point, rennet is added to coagulate the milk, or form the curd. The milk is then allowed to remain undisturbed until the action of the rennet is at a certain point, when the curd is cut into little cube-shaped pieces by drawing two sets of knives through it and thus is separated from the whey. As soon as the curd is cut, the temperature of the mass is raised to help make the curd firm and to cause the little cubes to retain their firmness, and during the entire heating process the whole mass is stirred constantly to assist in the separation from the whey. When the curd is sufficiently firm, the whey is removed and the particles of curd are allowed to adhere and form into a solid mass. If necessary, the curd is cut again into small pieces to get rid of the excess whey; but if the curd is too dry, the pieces must be piled up until they are four or five deep. During this process, which is known as the _cheddaring_ of the cheese, the curd is treated until it is of the proper texture to be _milled_, that is, put into a mill and ground into small pieces. The object of milling the curd is to cut it into pieces small enough to permit of uniform salting and the further escape of whey. When the curd has been brought to this point, it is salted and then pressed into molds. Finally, it is wrapped and cured, or ripened. 35. BRICK CHEESE.--Another American cheese that seems to meet with a popular demand is brick cheese. This kind of cheese, which is illustrated at _c_, Fig. 4, gets its name from the fact that it is pressed into \\\"bricks\\\" under the weight of one or two bricks. It is made from sweet milk, coagulated with rennet, cut with curd knives, and heated in the whey to firm it. Brick cheese is mild in flavor and of a moderately close texture. It is used chiefly as an accompaniment to other foods. 36. AMERICAN HOME-MADE CHEESE.--The making of Cheddar cheese and brick cheese is, of course, done commercially, but there is a kind of cheese that can be made very conveniently in the home. This home-made cheese, which is generally known as COTTAGE CHEESE, affords an excellent way in which to utilize left-over sour milk, particularly if a quart or more can be obtained at one time; smaller quantities can generally be used for baking purposes. If properly made, such cheese is very digestible. As it can be seasoned and served in a variety of ways, it makes a delightful addition to lunches or other light meals in which a protein dish, such as meat, is undesirable. Skim milk does very well for this kind of cheese, so that if the sour milk that is to be used has cream on it, the cream should be removed before the cheese is made; otherwise, it will remain in the whey and be lost. In case cream is desired to improve the texture and flavor of the cheese, it should be added after the cheese is made. [Illustration: FIG. 5] 37. To make cottage cheese, allow a quantity of sour milk to clabber, that is, become curdled, and then place it on the back of the stove in a thick vessel, such as a crock, until the whey begins to appear on the top, turning it occasionally so that it will heat very slowly and evenly. Do not allow the temperature to rise above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, or the curd will become tough and dry. Remember that the two things on which the success of this product depends are the flavor of the milk used and the proper heating of it. No difficulty will be encountered in the heating of the milk if a coal or a wood stove is used, but in case a gas stove must be used, the vessel containing the milk should be placed in a larger one containing warm water and the milk should be heated in this manner until the curd and the whey begin to separate. At this point, pour off all the whey possible, and turn the curd into a cloth bag or a colander lined with cloth, as shown in Fig. 5, and allow any remaining whey to drip out. If, after the whey is removed, the curd tastes sour, wash it with warm water and allow it to drip again. Then season it with salt to suit the taste and, provided cream is desired, add it at this time, using sweet or sour cream. To work in the cream, press it into the curd with a spoon until the cheese is quite smooth. Cheese made in this way may be flavored with anything desirable. For instance, chopped pimiento, parsley, olives, or nuts improve the flavor of the cheese very much and make a very appetizing combination. The dry curd mixed with any of these makes a delightful salad when it is pressed into balls, garnished with lettuce, and served with salad dressing. 38. JUNKET COTTAGE CHEESE.--Another variety of cottage cheese can be prepared by using sweet milk and forming the curd with a junket tablet, one tablet being required for each quart of milk. To make cheese of this kind, heat the milk until it is lukewarm, or not over 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and then add the junket tablet dissolved in cold milk or water. Keep the milk warm until the curd forms, and then break up the curd with a spoon and pour the whole mass into a bag or a colander lined with cloth. When all the whey is drained out, the curd, which will be sweet, can be seasoned in any desired way or mixed with cream and served. If more flavor is preferred, the curd may be allowed to sour or may be mixed with sour cream. 39. BUTTERMILK CREAM CHEESE.--A slight variation from the cottage cheeses just described is buttermilk cream cheese. This cheese is formed from the curd of buttermilk, which is finer in texture and not so likely to become tough as that formed from ordinary sour milk. To prepare buttermilk cream cheese, warm the buttermilk slowly, being careful not to allow the temperature to rise beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit. As the milk is heated, the curd will form and will gradually sink to the bottom of the vessel. After this occurs, remove the whey and mix the curd with a little thick cream. The result will be a mixture having a delightfully creamy consistency. SERVING CHEESE 40. Cheese does not lend itself readily to many ways of serving, still it frequently adds zest to many foods. When grated, it may be passed with tomato or vegetable soup and sprinkled in to impart an unusual flavor. In this form it may also be served with macaroni and other Italian pastes, provided cheese has not been included in the preparation of such foods. When sliced, little slices may be served nicely with any kind of pie or pastry and with some puddings, such as steamed fruit puddings. Thin slices or squares of cheese and crackers served with coffee after the dessert add a finishing touch to many meals. It will be well to note that crackers to be served with cheese should always be crisp. Unless they have just been taken from a fresh package, crackers can be improved by placing them in a moderate oven for a few minutes before serving. Also, firm crackers that do not crumble easily are best to serve with cheese, water crackers being especially desirable. * * * * * RECIPES FOR CHEESE DISHES EFFECT OF COOKING ON CHEESE 41. Because cheese is a highly concentrated food, it is generally considered to be indigestible; but this matter can be remedied by mixing the cheese with other foods and thus separating it into small particles that are more readily digested. The way in which this may be done depends on the nature of the cheese. Any of the dry cheeses or any of the moist cheeses that have become dry may be grated or broken into bits, but as it is difficult to treat the moist ones in this way, they must be brought to a liquid state by means of heat before they can be added to other foods. The cooking of cheese, however, has an effect on this food that should be thoroughly understood. It will be well to note, therefore, that the application of heat to the form of protein found in cheese causes this food substance to coagulate and harden, as in the case of the albumen of eggs. In the process of coagulation, the first effect is the melting of the cheese, and when it has been brought to this semiliquid state it can be easily combined with other foods, such as milk, eggs, soups, and sauces. In forming such combinations, the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda helps to blend the foods. Another characteristic of cheese that influences the cooking of it is that the fat it contains melts only at a low temperature, so that, on the whole, the methods of preparation that require a low temperature are the best for cooking these foods. However, a precaution that should be taken whenever cheese is heated is not to cook it too long, for long cooking makes it hard and leathery in consistency, and cheese in this state is difficult to digest. VARIETY OF CHEESE DISHES 42. As has already been learned, cheese lends itself very readily to a large variety of cooked dishes. For instance, it may be grated and sprinkled on the top of mashed or creamed potatoes and then browned by placing the dish in the oven. When it is grated or sliced, it may be arranged between the layers of macaroni or other food used to make a scalloped dish. Soups and sauces flavored with cheese are especially appetizing, a cream sauce of this kind served over toast or rice making an excellent luncheon dish. Toast or crackers spread with cheese and placed in the oven just long enough for the cheese to melt are delicious to serve with a salad course or with tea. To assist in the preparation of such combinations, as well as other cheese dishes, a number of recipes are here given. In making up these recipes, it will be well to note that unless the variety of cheese is stated explicitly, use should be made of American Cheddar cheese, or, as it is often called, _American cream cheese_, or _store cheese_. Of course, some similar hard cheese could be used if desired, but the kind mentioned is recommended for the sake of economy. [Illustration: FIG. 6] 43. CHEESE BONBONS.--A combination of cheese and nuts in the form of cheese bonbons, besides being very tasty, is highly nutritious, since both the cheese and the nuts used in making them are high in food value. Such bonbons, which are illustrated in Fig. 6, may be served with a light salad, such as a vegetable or a fruit salad, to add food value to the dish, or they may be served with wafers to take the place of a salad, when a small amount of some kind of tart jelly goes nicely with them. If the dessert for the dinner has been a very light one, these bonbons may be served with coffee and wafers after the dessert. They may be made as follows: CHEESE BONBONS (Sufficient for Twelve Bonbons) 1 pkg. Neufch\\u00e2tel or cream cheese 2 Tb. finely chopped pimiento 1/2 tsp. salt Few grains of paprika 1/3 c. half English-walnut meats Work the cheese smooth with the pimiento and other seasoning, and if the mixture is too dry add a little cream. Shape this into small balls, press each ball flat, and then place a half nut on top of each. If the pimiento is not desired, it may be omitted. 44. CHEESE SOUFFL\\u00c9.--As a dish that will take the place of meat in a light meal is often desired, cheese souffl\\u00e9, which is comparatively high in food value, finds much favor. This dish contains milk, eggs, and cheese, as is shown in the accompanying recipe, and so may actually be considered as a protein dish and used accordingly. Souffl\\u00e9 is served in the dish in which it is baked, but if it is quite firm and is to be eaten at once, it may be removed from the ramekin to a plate. CHEESE SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 Tb. butter 4 Tb. flour 1-1/4 c. milk 3/4 c. grated cheese Dash of paprika 1/2 tsp. salt 3 eggs Melt the butter, add the flour, mix well, and then gradually add the milk, which should be scalded. To this sauce add the cheese, paprika, and salt. When thoroughly mixed, remove from the fire and add the beaten yolks of eggs, beating rapidly. Cool and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pour into a buttered baking dish or in ramekins and bake 20 minutes in a slow oven. Serve at once. 45. CHEESE OMELET.--Grated cheese added to an omelet gives it a delightful flavor. Since such an omelet is a high-protein dish, it should never be served in the same meal in which meat, fish, or other protein foods are served, but should be used as the main dish of a luncheon or a light supper. CHEESE OMELET (Sufficient to Serve Four) 4 eggs 4 Tb. hot water 1/2 tsp. salt 2 Tb. bread crumbs 1 c. grated cheese 1 Tb. butter Beat the egg yolks thoroughly and add to them the hot water, salt, crumbs, and cheese. Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry, and fold them carefully into the yolk mixture. Heat the butter in an omelet pan. Pour in the mixture, brown very slowly over the heat, and then place in the oven to cook the top. Serve at once. 46. CHEESE SAUCE.--To give a distinctive flavor to white sauce, cheese is often added to it. A sauce flavored in this way lends itself nicely to the garnishing of croquettes or souffl\\u00e9s, and it will be found quite tasty if it is served over some vegetables, such as steamed cauliflower, mashed potatoes, or rice served as a vegetable. Such sauce may also be served over toast to make an attractive luncheon dish. CHEESE SAUCE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. milk 4 Tb. flour 4 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. paprika 1/2 c. grated cheese Make a white sauce of the milk, flour, butter, salt, and paprika, and to it add the grated cheese. If desired, a dash of catsup or chili sauce may be added for flavoring. 47. CHEESE TOAST.--When toast has added to it eggs, milk, and cheese, as in the recipe here given, it is sufficiently high in protein to serve as a meat substitute and is a particularly good dish for a light meal. It combines well with a vegetable salad for luncheon and is an excellent dish to serve for Sunday night supper, when very little else need be served with it. CHEESE TOAST (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. milk 4 Tb. flour 4 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt 3/4 c. grated cheese 2 hard-cooked eggs 6 squares of toast Make a white sauce of the milk, flour, butter, and salt, and to it add 1/2 cupful of the grated cheese and the egg whites chopped fine. Arrange the toast on a platter, pour the sauce over it, sprinkle the top with the egg yolks that have been run through a ricer or a sieve, and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cupful of cheese over all. Place in hot oven or under a broiler until the cheese melts a little. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 7] 48. WELSH RAREBIT.--Whenever a dish that can be made in a chafing dish is desired, Welsh rarebit is immediately thought of. This is possibly due to the fact that this tasty cheese dish is very often served at evening parties, when a crowd may gather around a table and enjoy the preparation of this food in the chafing dish. This kind of cooking utensil, together with its outfit, which consists of a long-handled spoon and fork, is shown in Fig. 7. As will be observed, a chafing dish consists of a frame to which is attached a lamp that provides the heat, a pan in which water is placed, another pan with a handle in which the food is cooked, and a cover. The heat for cooking is furnished by alcohol, although it is possible to get chafing dishes that are heated by electricity. Chafing dishes are used by many housewives, for in addition to the use mentioned, they serve very well for the making of practically any kind of creamed dish, including those in which sea foods and vegetables are used, as well as for the saut\\u00e9ing of foods. It should not be understood, however, that Welsh rarebit must be made in a chafing dish, for this food can be prepared as well in a heavy frying pan or a double boiler; nor should it be taken for granted that it is served only at parties, for it may be served as the main dish for luncheon or supper. Rarebit is often flavored with ale or beer, but this is not required to make an appetizing dish, as the following recipe shows. WELSH RAREBIT (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 Tb. butter 1 Tb. flour 1 c. milk 1/4 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. paprika 1/2 lb. cheese cut into small pieces 6 slices of toast or 6 wafers Melt the butter, add to it the flour, and stir until smooth. Gradually add the milk, and cook for a few minutes; then add the salt, paprika, and cheese, stirring until the cheese is melted. The finished rarebit should not be stringy. Pour over the toast or wafers and serve. 49. ENGLISH MONKEY.--Another cheese dish that is frequently made in a chafing dish and served from it is English monkey, but this may likewise be made with ordinary kitchen utensils and served directly on plates from the kitchen or from a bowl on the table. A dish of this kind is most satisfactory if it is served as soon as the sauce is poured over toast or wafers and before they have had time to become soaked. English monkey may be made according to the following recipe and served for the same purposes as Welsh rarebit. ENGLISH MONKEY (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. bread crumbs 1 c. milk 1 Tb. butter 1/2 c. soft cheese cut into small pieces 1 egg 1/2 tsp. salt 6 buttered wafers Soak the bread crumbs in the milk. Melt the butter and add to it the cheese, stirring until the cheese is melted. Then add the soaked crumbs, the slightly beaten egg, and the salt. Cook for a few minutes and pour over wafers and serve. If desired, toast may be used in place of the wafers. 50. CHEESE-AND-MACARONI LOAF.--Macaroni combined with cheese makes a high-protein dish that very readily takes the place of meat and that may be served as the main dish in a dinner. If this combination is made into a loaf and baked well in an oblong bread pan, it may be turned out on a platter and cut into slices. In case a loaf is not desired, it may be baked in a baking dish and served directly from that. In either form, it is made more appetizing by the addition of a tomato sauce. CHEESE-AND-MACARONI LOAF (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1/2 c. macaroni (inch lengths) 1 c. milk 1 c. bread crumbs 2 Tb. chopped green peppers 1 Tb. chopped onion 1 Tb. chopped parsley 2 eggs 2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1 c. grated cheese 1 Tb. butter Cook the macaroni according to the directions given in _Cereals_. When it is thoroughly soft, drain off the water and mix the macaroni with the milk, bread crumbs, green pepper, onion, parsley, well-beaten egg, salt, pepper, and grated cheese. Place in a baking dish, dot the top with butter, and bake in a moderate oven until the mixture is set. Serve with or without sauce, as desired. 51. CHEESE FONDUE.--A dish that is very similar to cheese souffl\\u00e9 and that must be served as soon as it comes from the oven in order to avoid shrinking is cheese fondue. It satisfactorily takes the place of meat in a light meal, and may be served from a large dish or from individual baking dishes with or without sauce, as desired. CHEESE FONDUE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 1/2 c. soft bread crumbs 1 1/2 c. grated cheese 1 c. hot milk 4 eggs 1/2 tsp. salt Mix the bread crumbs and cheese, and add them to the hot milk, beaten egg yolks, and salt. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Bake in a buttered baking dish for about 30 minutes in a moderate oven. Serve at once. 52. CHEESE DREAMS.--If something delicious to serve with fruit or salad is desired for luncheon or Sunday night supper, the accompanying recipe for cheese dreams should be tried. They should be served at once on being taken from the stove, because as soon as they cool the cheese hardens and they are not appetizing. Cheese dreams may be saut\\u00e9d or prepared in a broiler or an oven, but if they are saut\\u00e9d, they may be made in a chafing dish. CHEESE DREAMS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 12 thinly cut slices of bread Butter Cheese sliced 1/8 in. thick Spread the bread thinly with butter and make sandwiches by placing a slice of cheese between two slices of bread. Place these sandwiches under a broiler or in a very hot oven and toast them on both sides, or omit the butter from the center, place the sandwiches in a slightly oiled frying pan, and brown them on both sides. In heating the sandwiches, the cheese melts. Serve hot. 53. CHEESE WAFERS.--If made daintily, cheese wafers may be served with salad or with tea for afternoon tea. The wafers selected for this purpose should be small and the layer of cheese not very thick. If a very thin broth is served at the beginning of a meal, cheese wafers may accompany it, but they should never be served with a heavy soup. CHEESE WAFERS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 doz. wafers Butter 3/4 grated cheese Paprika Spread the wafers thinly with butter and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoonful of grated cheese and a pinch of paprika. Bake in a hot oven until the cheese is melted. Cool and serve. [Illustration: FIG. 8] 54. CHEESE STRAWS.--Nothing can be more delightful to serve with a vegetable salad than cheese straws, which are illustrated in Fig. 8. An attractive way to serve them is to slip them through small rings made out of strips of the dough mixture and baked at the same time the straws are baked and then place them at the side of the salad plate. They may accompany a fruit salad, as well as a vegetable salad, but they are not appropriate for serving with a meat or a fish salad. CHEESE STRAWS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 Tb. butter 2/3 c. flour 1 c. bread crumbs 1 c. grated or cut cheese 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper Pinch of Cayenne pepper 1/2 c. milk Cream the butter and to it add the flour, bread crumbs, cheese, and seasonings. Mix thoroughly and add the milk. Roll 1/4 inch thick and then cut 1/4 inch wide and 6 inches long. Bake until brown in a moderately hot oven. 55. TOMATOES WITH CHEESE STUFFING.--The addition of cheese to the stuffing used in stuffed tomatoes means added flavor, as well as nutritive value in the form of protein, the food substance in which the tomatoes themselves are lacking. The bread crumbs used for the stuffing supply a large amount of carbohydrate, so that the completed dish, besides being a very attractive one, contains all the food principles in fairly large quantities. Stuffed tomatoes may be served as the main dish in a light meal or as a vegetable dish in a heavy meal. TOMATOES WITH CHEESE STUFFING (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 tomatoes 1 c. bread crumbs 1 c. grated cheese 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. butter 1/4 c. hot water Select medium-sized tomatoes and hollow out the centers. Mix the crumbs, cheese, salt, pepper, butter, and hot water with the pulp from the centers of the tomatoes. Fill the tomatoes with this stuffing, place in a pan, and bake in a moderate oven until the tomato can be pierced easily with a fork. Serve hot. 56. FIGS STUFFED WITH CHEESE.--As cheese is a very concentrated food, it is often combined with another food to offset this effect. An excellent combination is formed by stuffing figs with cheese. Figs prepared in this way will be found to be very attractive and tasty and may be served in the place of a dessert or a salad, depending on the kind and size of the meal with which they are used. FIGS STUFFED WITH CHEESE (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1 pkg. Neufch\\u00e2tel or cream cheese 2 Tb. cream 8 small pulled figs Work the cheese and cream until soft. Steam the figs for 10 or 15 minutes or until they are soft; then cool them, cut out their stems, fill their centers with the soft cheese, and serve. 57. CHEESE SANDWICHES.--Very appetizing sandwiches that may be used to take the place of meat sandwiches or a protein dish at any time are made with a cheese filling. If these are made very small and dainty, they may be served with salad in a light meal. The addition of pickles, olives, and pimiento, which are included in the accompanying recipe, makes the filling more attractive than the usual plain cheese by producing in it a variety of tastes. They also add bulk, which is lacking in both the white bread and the cheese. If desired, graham or whole-wheat bread may be used in place of white bread. CHEESE SANDWICHES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1/4 lb. cheese 2 medium-sized pickles 1/2 pimiento Meat from 1/2 doz. olives 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. paprika Bread Put the cheese, pickles, pimiento, and olives through a food chopper, and when chopped add the salt and the paprika. If the mixture is not moist enough to spread, add salad dressing or vinegar until it is of the right consistency. Mix well and spread on thinly cut, buttered slices of bread. LUNCHEON MENU 58. Many of the dishes for which recipes are given in this Section, particularly those including cheese as one of the ingredients, do very well for the main dish in a light meal, such as luncheon. In order that practice may be had in preparing a well-balanced luncheon that includes a dish of this kind, a luncheon menu is here presented. The cheese souffl\\u00e9, which has been selected as the main dish in this menu, should be made according to the directions already given. Little difficulty will be experienced in making the other dishes, as recipes for them are given immediately after the menu. All the recipes are intended for six persons, so that if more or fewer are to be served, the recipes should be changed accordingly. This menu is presented with the intention that it be tried by each student and a report of it then prepared according to the plan outlined and sent with the work of the Examination Questions. MENU Cream-of-Corn Soup Cheese Souffl\\u00e9 Stewed Tomatoes Saut\\u00e9d Potatoes Brown Bread and Butter Baked Apples Black Tea RECIPES CREAM-OF-CORN SOUP 1 Tb. flour 1 Tb. butter 1 pt. milk 1 c. canned corn 1 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper Make a white sauce of the flour, butter, and milk. Force the corn through a colander or sieve and add the pur\\u00e9e to the white sauce. Season with the salt and pepper and serve. SAUT\\u00c9D POTATOES 6 medium-sized cooked potatoes 2 Tb. butter 1-1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper Slice the boiled potatoes thin and put the slices in a frying pan in which the butter has been melted. Add the salt and pepper. Allow the potatoes to cook until well browned, turning frequently during the cooking. Serve hot. STEWED TOMATOES 1 Tb. butter 1 small onion 6 medium-sized ripe tomatoes or 1 can of tomatoes 1 tsp. salt 2 Tb. sugar 1/4 tsp. pepper 1 Tb. flour Brown the butter in a saucepan, slice the onion into it, and cook for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes. If fresh tomatoes are to be used, remove the skins, cut into pieces, put into the saucepan with a few tablespoonfuls of water, and cook until the tomatoes are thoroughly softened. If canned tomatoes are to be used, merely allow them to come to the boiling point. Add the salt, sugar, and pepper, and, a few minutes before removing from the fire, moisten the flour with a tablespoonful of cold water and stir into the tomato. Cook for a few minutes and serve. BAKED APPLES 6 medium-sized apples 1 lemon 3/4 c. sugar 1/2 c. water Wipe and core the apples. Put them into a baking dish and place a slice of lemon on the top of each. Make a sirup of the sugar and the water, pour this around the apples, and bake slowly until they can be pierced easily with a fork. Serve hot or cold, with a teaspoonful of jelly on the top of each apple. BLACK TEA 6 tsp. black tea 6 c. boiling water Scald out the pot with freshly boiling water, pour in the tea, add the 6 cupfuls of freshly boiling water, and allow it to stand on the leaves until the tea is strong enough to serve. Then either pour the tea off the leaves and keep it hot or serve at once. MILK, BUTTER, AND CHEESE (PART 2) EXAMINATION QUESTIONS (1) From what part of milk is butter made?

Eggs are of great importance in the diet, and to appreciate this fact fully the true nature of this food must be understood. For domestic use, the eggs of guinea hens, turkeys, ducks, and geese occasionally find favor, but as eggs laid by hens are the kind that is commonly used, it is to such eggs that this Section is devoted. A hen's egg may really be considered as an undeveloped chicken, because it contains all the elements required to build the body of the chick and provide it with the energy it needs to pick its way into the world. When it emerges from the shell, it is fully developed, and in a short time it begins an independent existence, seeking and finding its own food. The fact that eggs store so much nutritive material explains to some extent why they are a valuable source of food for man and why they are used so extensively. However, as in the case of milk, the elements that eggs contain are not in just the right proportion for the sole nourishment of a human being, so they must generally be used in combination with other foods. 2. Most persons are familiar with the appearance of eggs, but in order that satisfactory results may be obtained in their selection, care, and cooking, it will be necessary to look into the details of their composition. As is well known, an egg consists of a porous shell lined with a fine, but tough, membrane that encloses the white and the yolk and serves to protect them. The yolk is divided from the white by a delicate membrane, which permits it to be separated from the white when an egg is carefully broken. This membrane extends to each end of the shell in the form of a small cord, and it is so fastened to the shell as to hold the yolk evenly suspended. The porous nature of an egg shell is required to give air to the developing chick, but it is this characteristic that permits eggs to spoil as they grow old and are exposed to air, for through these minute pores, or openings, the water in the egg evaporates and air and bacteria enter. Of course, as the water evaporates and is replaced by air, the egg becomes lighter. Because of this fact, the freshness of eggs can be determined by placing them in water. When they are fresh, they will sink in cold water, but as they decompose they become lighter and will float. Since it is known that the spoiling of eggs is due to the entrance of air through the porous shell, it may be inferred that their decay may be prevented either by protecting the shell so that air cannot enter or by keeping the eggs at so low a temperature that bacteria cannot grow. Although stored eggs always deteriorate more or less, both of these methods of preservation have proved very satisfactory, the former being used largely in the home and the latter finding its solution in cold storage. A knowledge of how eggs can be preserved, however, is of great value, for if there were no means of preservation and eventual marketing, the price of eggs would at times rise to actual prohibitive limits. 3. That eggs as an article of food are growing in importance is indicated by the fact that their production has come to be a large and widely distributed industry. Owing to the private consumption and sale of eggs, an accurate statement of the number of eggs produced is difficult to give. Still, in a report, the United States Bureau of Agriculture estimated the value of the yearly egg production at something more than three million dollars, with an allowance of about 210 eggs, or 17-1/2 dozen, per capita each year, or 4 eggs a week for each person. These figures, however, are only suggestive of the production, use, and value of eggs, for as the population increases so does the use of eggs. In fact, they are proving to be almost indispensable to the cook, the baker, the manufacturers of certain foods, and many others. 4. With the increase in the demand for eggs has come a corresponding steady advance in the money value of this product and, consequently, an increase in its price. The housewife who would practice economy in cookery can readily see, therefore, that with reference to the number of eggs required and the ways in which they are used, she must choose carefully the recipes and methods she employs. If the eggs are always considered a part of a meal, their use is seldom an extravagance, even at such high prices as they sometimes attain. On the other hand, if a dessert that requires the use of many eggs is added to a meal that is itself sufficient in food value, it is not unreasonable to regard such use of eggs as an extravagance. A point that should be taken into consideration in the use of eggs in the diet, especially when their price seems very high, is that there is no waste matter in them, unless the shell is regarded as waste. Therefore, they are often more economical than other foods that can be bought for less money. It must not be understood, however, that eggs are used only as an article of diet. They are also a very important food ingredient, being employed in the preparation of many kinds of dishes. For instance, they are often used to thicken custards, sauces, etc.; to clarify soups and jellies; to lighten cakes, puddings, hot breads, and other baked mixtures; to form the basis for salad dressings; and to combine or hold together many varieties of food. NUTRITIVE VALUE OF EGGS 5. Like milk, eggs are often spoken of as a perfect food. Still, as has been pointed out, they are not a perfect food for man, but they are of especial nutritive value and should be used freely in the diet just as long as their cost neither limits nor prohibits their use. An idea of how they compare with other nutritious foods can be obtained from Fig. 1, which shows that eight eggs are equal in food value to 1 quart of milk or 1 pound and 5 ounces of beefsteak. A better understanding of their food value, however, can be gained from a study of their composition. [Illustration: FIG. 1] 6. Since an egg is an undeveloped chick that requires only the addition of warmth to develop it into a living, moving creature made of muscles, bones, and blood, it is evident that this food contains considerable tissue-building and energy-producing material. The exact proportion of this material, as well as the other substances found in eggs, is given in the food chart shown in _Essentials of Cookery_, Part 1. The chart relating to the composition of eggs points out that the edible portion of the whole egg consists of 73.7 per cent. of water, 14.8 per cent. of protein, 10.5 per cent. of fat, and about 1 per cent. of ash, or mineral matter. The protein, which is chiefly in the form of albumen, and the fat are the most digestible of these elements, while the mineral constituents are as valuable for the growing child as for the chick. When the total weight of an egg is taken into consideration, the shell constitutes about 11 per cent., the yolk 32 per cent., and the white 57 per cent. The composition of the yolk and the white differs somewhat, the yolk having the greater food value, a fact that is also clearly indicated in the chart. The white contains a larger proportion of water than the yolk, but the yolk contains the most of the fat and more protein and mineral matter, or ash, than the white. In addition, the chart shows that the number of calories to the pound of whole egg is 700, of egg yolk is 1,608, and of egg white is 265. 7. PROTEIN IN EGGS.--The nature of the food substances in eggs is of nearly as great importance as their amount, for they not only determine the value of this food in the body, but influence its cooking. That protein is present in both the yolk and the white is apparent from the fact that they coagulate when heat is applied. Because eggs are high in protein, containing 14.8 per cent. of this substance, they may be regarded as equivalent to a meat dish, and it is only when they are extremely high in price that they cannot be frequently substituted for meat to advantage. They are often used to take the place of milk, too, for eggs and milk are more alike in nutritive value than any other two protein foods; but, of the two, milk yields the cheaper form of protein. Like meat and milk, eggs are rich in all those food materials which enter into the construction of bone, muscle, and blood. 8. FAT IN EGGS.--A study of the food chart previously mentioned will show that eggs contain proportionately almost as much fat as protein and that nearly all this fat is found in the yolk. Since fat produces more heat or energy, weight for weight, than any other food substance, and since eggs contain neither starch nor sugar, it is evident that the fat of this food is the main source of the energy-producing material. Fat in eggs occurs in the form of an emulsion, or tiny particles, and, like the fat of milk, is very readily digested. It is for this reason that both of these foods are particularly well adapted to the diet of both children and adults. The presence of quantities of protein and fat and the absence of carbohydrate in eggs indicate that the proper thing to combine with this food, in order to have a well-balanced meal when eggs are eaten, is carbohydrate in some form. 9. MINERALS IN EGGS.--Eggs are especially valuable for the mineral salts they contain, chief among which are lime, phosphorus, sulphur, iron, potassium, and sodium. For this reason, the addition of eggs to any kind of diet supplies a large amount of the minerals that are needed for bone, blood, and tissue building. A favorable point concerning the minerals found in eggs is that they are not affected to any extent by cooking. Therefore, in the preparation of any dish, if eggs are added to other foods, that dish will contain an additional amount of mineral salts, plus the nutritive value of the eggs. 10. DIGESTIBILITY OF EGGS.--In connection with the discussion of the food substances of which eggs are composed, it will be well to note how these affect the digestibility of this food. But just what is meant by this characteristic with reference to eggs must first be understood. In some foods, digestibility may mean the length of time required for them to digest; in others, the completeness of the digestion; and in still others, the ease and comfort with which the process of digestion proceeds. In the case of eggs, digestibility refers to the quantity of this food that is absorbed, that is, actually dissolved and permitted to enter the blood stream. The nutritive value of eggs is not so high as would naturally be supposed, for, although the protein, fat, and mineral salts of an egg make up about one-fourth of its contents, one egg equals in nutritive value only 1/2 cupful of milk, a small potato, or a medium-sized apple. However, when the proportion of the nutritive material that the body retains from this food, or its digestibility, is considered, eggs rank extremely high, it having been determined by experiments that 97 per cent. of the protein and 95 per cent. of the fat are assimilated. A point worthy of note in this connection, though, is that eggs contain no cellulose, such as that found in grains, vegetables, and fruits. Therefore, in order to add the much-needed bulk to the diet, foods that do contain cellulose should be served with eggs. 11. Whether or not the cooking of eggs has any effect on their digestibility is a matter that has also been investigated. The results of the experiments made indicate that cooking makes some difference with the rate of digestion, but very little with its thoroughness. So far as the rapidity of digestion is concerned, there is very little difference between raw eggs and slightly cooked eggs; but hard-cooked eggs, although they may be digested as completely as soft-cooked ones, require longer time for the accomplishment of the process. This is due to the fact that the whites of hard-cooked eggs are so firm in texture that, unless they are finely chopped or thoroughly masticated, the digestive juices are not able to act on them quickly. As a result, portions of them may escape digestion or remain in the digestive tract for some time and decompose. For this reason, hard-cooked eggs are usually excluded from the diet of children and invalids, and even healthy adults should be careful to masticate them thoroughly. SELECTION OF EGGS 12. On first thought it would seem as if there is very little to guide the housewife in the selection of eggs, it being extremely difficult to tell from their external appearance whether or not they are fresh or stale. As a rule, she must trust largely to the honesty of the person from whom she buys eggs. Still she need not depend entirely on the dealer's word, for, at least to a certain extent, there are ways in which she may judge the quality of eggs. Because of the great value of eggs as a food and for cooking purposes, it is important that the housewife make use of all available information on this matter and, in addition, become familiar with the trade practices in the egg industry. 13. MARKETING OF EGGS.--As is generally known, hens lay a large number of eggs in the spring of the year, but they do not lay readily in the cold winter months; and not alone are the greatest quantities of eggs produced in April and May, but those laid at this time are of the best quality. Because of this condition and in order that the demand during the time of scarcity may be supplied, it is necessary that a considerable number of eggs be preserved when they are comparatively cheap and abundant. Also, in the preserving of eggs for future use, it is of the greatest importance that they be kept in the best possible condition and manner, so that when they are used, months after they are laid, they may be as good as it is possible to have them. The advance made in storage and transportation methods in recent years has done much toward making the egg supply uniform all the year around. Not long ago, because of inadequate means of storage and shipping, eggs were sold only a short distance from the place where they were produced. However, with the coming of cold storage and improved methods of shipping, eggs have been changed from a perishable and more or less seasonable food to a staple one. Now it is possible to collect them in large quantities, to keep them for a considerable time before selling them, and to ship them long distances. To safeguard the public, though, authorities have set a time limit for the storage of eggs, the legal time they may be kept being 8 months. By this is meant that eggs placed in the warehouse in May must be released or sold in December; whereas, those stored in June must be released no later than January. 14. Eggs that have been kept too long in storage are characterized by a musty odor and flavor, the breaking of the yolk and its mixing with the white, and a watery condition of the white. Such eggs, of course, cannot be sold legally. Those which may be placed on the market are graded according to their freshness, cleanliness, size, cracks, and color. With the exception of their freshness, these points can be readily told from the appearance of the eggs; but, in order to determine whether an egg is fresh or not, it is generally put through a process known as _candling_, by which the interior condition of the egg can be ascertained. In the grading of eggs, all those of the best size, color, and condition are sold under a particular trade name and bring a high or a low price, according to the grading. Others that are not so perfect are put in another grade and sell for prices that vary according to the demand. Eggs, of course, differ in appearance and in many cases they are sorted in order to satisfy the demand. For instance, in some localities, eggs having a brown shell sell for the highest price, while in other places, eggs having a white shell are in the greatest demand and bring the highest price. Unsorted eggs are not held in much favor and do not bring so good a price as those which are all one color. Many persons have an idea that the color of the shell of an egg bears some relation to its nutritive value and flavor. However, authorities on foods agree that, other things being alike, the edible portion of white-shelled eggs has essentially the same composition and nutritive value as that of dark-shelled eggs. 15. QUALITY OF EGGS.--The natural quality of eggs depends largely on the food of the hens and their conditions of living. Because of this fact, the selection, breeding, and care of fowls have developed into a science, particularly since the production of eggs has grown into an industry. When the quality itself is to be determined, all the characteristics of eggs must be taken into consideration; still there is one particular point on which the quality of eggs depends, and that is their freshness. Various agencies, however, are constantly at work to render this quality inferior. Chief among these are the molds and bacteria that pass through the porous shells of eggs that have been improperly cared for or have become contaminated by being allowed to remain in unclean surroundings. Such bacteria are responsible for the unpleasant flavors that are found in bad eggs. Because of their harmful effect, every effort should be made to prevent the entrance of the germs that cause decay, and, as has been stated, the best way in which to accomplish this is to protect the shell. If it is found that bacteria have entered, the eggs will become unfit for use quickly unless their growth is prevented. This may be done by storing the eggs at a temperature that will keep the bacteria dormant, or inert. 16. If the eggs are kept under the proper conditions, they will not actually spoil for a long time; but it is seldom that they are not more or less affected by storage of any kind that covers a period of several months. One change that can always be looked for in such eggs is in the air space at the broad end. When an egg is first laid, this air space is small, but since the water contained in the egg slowly evaporates through the porous shell it increases in size as the egg grows staler. For this reason, the freshness of an egg can often be determined by the size of this air space. In addition, the purposes for which eggs are used are somewhat affected by their storage. A stale egg, although it may not be actually spoiled to the extent that it cannot be used as food, will not produce such good results in a cooking process as a fresh egg, especially if it is used for leavening. In fact, it is impossible to produce the desired results with eggs that have undergone a certain amount of change, even though their odor and their flavor do not indicate that they are spoiled. 17. JUDGING THE QUALITY OF EGGS IN THE MARKET.--While, as has been mentioned, the housewife must depend considerably on the dealer's word as to the freshness of the eggs she purchases, it will be well for her to be familiar with the trade names of eggs and their meaning. The names used differ, of course, in various localities, but all large distributors grade and name eggs in much the same way. In deciding on the grade to which eggs belong, a certain number of points are given for color, size, freshness, and appearance, and the sum total of these points determines the grade, a special name being given for each grade. For instance, eggs that can be graded 90 are called _extra fancy_; those which receive a grade of 80, _fancy_; those which are graded 70, _strictly fresh_; and those which can be graded only 60, _cooking eggs_. When eggs are put on the market under such names, it can be expected that the quality will correspond to the grade and the price will vary with the grade. Therefore, the trade name and the price are two of the principal ways in which the quality of eggs in the market may be judged. 18. Another way of judging the quality of eggs consists in observing the condition of the surface of the shell. When eggs are freshly laid, the shell is covered with a substance, called _bloom_, that gives it a feeling much like that of a thin lime coating deposited in a pan after water boils. This coating disappears gradually as the egg is exposed to the air, but as long as it remains, the egg may be considered as fresh and germ-proof. While this way of determining freshness is probably the quickest, it is possible that the quality of some eggs from which the bloom has recently disappeared has not been injured. 19. When eggs are selected in the market, certain points in their appearance should also be noted. If eggs of the best quality are desired, medium-sized ones that are uniform in size and color should be selected. With regard to shape, they should have a comparatively long oval shell, one end of which is blunt and the other, a sharp curve. [Illustration: FIG. 2: Internal structure of egg.] [Illustration: FIG. 3: FRESH, 3 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS, OLDER.] 20. JUDGING THE QUALITY OF EGGS IN THE HOME.--After eggs have been received in the home, several simple tests for determining their freshness can be applied in addition to the ones already mentioned. A rather indefinite test, but one that is sometimes applied to determine the freshness of an egg, is to shake it. However, to be able to carry out this test successfully, it is well to understand the interior structure of an egg. Fig. 2 illustrates this clearly. At _a_ is shown the air space previously mentioned; at _b_, the spiral cords that run from the yolk to each end of the egg and hold the yolk in place; at _c_, the yolk; and at _d_, the white. When the water inside the shell evaporates, the yolk and white shrink so much that they can be felt moving from side to side when the egg is shaken. The staler the egg, the more pronounced does the movement become. This method should be applied only immediately before the egg is to be used, as the thin membrane between the yolk and the white and the spiral cords that hold up the yolk are liable to be disturbed by the shaking. If they are broken, the yolk will settle and finally adhere to the shell in case the egg is stored for any length of time after that. [Illustration: FIG. 4: Testing the egg.] [Illustration: FIG. 5: four eggs.] 21. If nothing has been done to preserve eggs, the simple test for freshness illustrated in Fig. 3, which consists in placing the eggs in a glass containing water, will be found effective. A perfectly fresh egg will sink when it is put into the water, but if the egg is 3 weeks old the broad end will rise slightly from the bottom of the glass. An egg that is 3 months old will sink into water until only a slight portion of the shell remains exposed; whereas, if the egg is older or stale, it will rise in the water until nearly half of it is exposed. 22. The test known as candling, which is usually applied to eggs before they are put on the market, can also be practiced by the housewife in the home. This method of determining the freshness of eggs consists in placing a piece of cardboard containing a hole a little smaller than an egg between the eye and a light, which may be from a lamp, a gas jet, or an electric light, and holding the egg in front of the light in the manner shown in Fig. 4. The rays of light passing through the egg show the condition of the egg, the size of its air space, and the growth of mold or the spoiling of the egg by any ordinary means. [Illustration: FIG. 6 (_a_) (_b_)] In Fig. 5 is shown how an egg at various stages of freshness appears when candled. When an egg is fresh, it will appear as in (_a_); that is, the yolk will be barely distinguishable from the white except as a slightly darker area in the center of the egg, and the entire egg will appear clear and bright and free from spots. In an egg that is a little older, candling will reveal a slightly darker yolk, a cloudy white, and a larger air space, as in (_b_). In a watery egg, or one that is beginning to spoil, various dark spots and blotches usually develop, as view (_c_) indicates. When an egg is rotten, the contents of the shell will look dark in candling and the yolk will appear to be mixed with the white, as in (_d_). 23. If the housewife does not wish to resort to candling, she may determine the condition of an egg by breaking it into a saucer and examining it carefully. If the egg is newly laid, no odor will be detected and the white will be clear, elastic, and rather thick; also, where it joins the yolk it will be almost solid. The yolk of such an egg will have an even yellow color, without lighter or darker spots and, as shown in Fig. 6 (_a_), will stand up well from the surface of the white. Sometimes a small spot of blood may be detected on the yolk of a perfectly fresh egg, but, while this is not pleasant to look at, it does not affect the quality of the egg. When an egg that is not real fresh is broken into a saucer, the yolk will lie flat, as in (_b_). In an egg that is quite stale, the membrane surrounding the yolk is easily destroyed, so that even when such an egg is broken carefully the yolk and the white are likely to run together. * * * * * PRESERVATION OF EGGS CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF DETERIORATION 24. As has been implied in the discussion given thus far, eggs will deteriorate or spoil in a comparatively short time unless something is done to preserve them. In view of the eggs she keeps on hand at home, as well as those she buys, the causes of spoiling and the ways in which to prevent spoiling are matters with which the housewife should be familiar, particularly if she would secure for her family eggs of the best quality at prices that are not beyond her means. The spoiling of eggs is due to decomposition, which is caused by molds or bacteria that result from accidental causes, and, in fertile eggs, to the germination and development of the chick, which is a natural process. The loss of quality resulting from molds and bacteria in the egg is brought about by their growth and by the formation of chemical compounds, which give spoiled eggs their peculiar appearance, taste, and odor. Some of these molds are not injurious to health, while others may give rise to more or less serious illness. 25. Various methods have been devised whereby their rapid deterioration may be prevented, and a knowledge of these is important to those who have occasion to purchase eggs or to keep them over from the season of plenty to the season of scarcity. The method followed to prevent losses due to the development of the embryo consists in the production of infertile eggs--that is, eggs that are non-productive. This is a point that is as well worth remembering in the home production of eggs as it is in professional poultry raising. The method employed to prevent the infection of eggs by molds and bacteria is to keep them clean and dry from the time they are laid until they are finally used. 26. While the preservation of eggs is carried on to a greater extent at present than formerly, the idea is neither new nor original; indeed, it has been practiced for many years by the people of some foreign countries. For instance, in some sections of China, duck eggs are preserved by covering them with a layer of mud, and such eggs are often kept for a year or more before they are eaten. However, eggs stored in this way decompose and their odor and flavor disappear before they are used, so that they must usually be hard boiled before they can be eaten. Egg preservation such as is practiced in the United States is the opposite of this and attempts to prevent not only ripening processes and putrefactive changes but any bacterial or other changes that lessen the original quality. It will be well to note, however, that eggs preserved for any length of time deteriorate to some extent and cannot be expected to be equally as good as fresh eggs. COMMERCIAL PRESERVATION OF EGGS 27. The usual market method of preserving eggs is by cold storage, an industry that has developed to vast proportions in recent years. The success of this method depends on the fact that germs causing decomposition will not live in a low temperature. While the plan of storing eggs is responsible for their high price at certain times, it is also a means of supplying eggs to many persons who would otherwise not be able to obtain them. The greatest point in favor of this plan, however, is that it makes possible the marketing of quantities of eggs during the winter season of scarcity at a price that, although somewhat high at times, is much more moderate than it would be if it were not possible to store eggs in large quantities. 28. In order that advantage may be taken of favorable climatic conditions, eggs are commonly purchased for storage as early in the year as they are abundant. They are selected with great care, only those which are clean, sound, and fresh being used. These eggs are packed in clean cases, and then placed in warehouses where they are kept at a temperature just above freezing, or one that ranges from 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. In such storage, precaution is usually taken to prevent the eggs from freezing, for while freezing does not necessarily injure them for immediate use it breaks the shell because of the contraction that occurs. While the eggs are in storage, they are also protected as far as possible from air circulation, as this increases evaporation and causes the contents of eggs to shrink. To prevent the yolks from settling to one side, and finally adhering to the shell, the eggs are turned frequently. The usual limits of storage are from 6 to 9 months, but eggs are not generally allowed to remain in storage more than 8 months. When taken out at the end of that time, it will be found that they have deteriorated very little, and while they cannot compete with the better grades of fresh eggs, they are as desirable as most of the eggs that can be purchased in the early fall when eggs are not plentiful. 29. Sometimes eggs are removed from the shells, stored for commercial use in containers of about 50 pounds each, and kept at the freezing point until they are to be used. Eggs in this form, which may be bought with the yolks and whites either mixed or separate, find a ready market in bakeries and restaurants, where large quantities of eggs are continually used. Such eggs remain good for any length of time while they are kept frozen, but they must be used immediately after they are removed from storage. 30. It is not always necessary to keep eggs at a cold temperature in order to preserve them, for a method that has proved very satisfactory is to reduce them to the form of powder by drying them. In this form, the bulk is greatly reduced, 1 pound of the dry material representing 30 to 40 eggs, and in order to prepare them for use in cooking they must be mixed with water. POWDERED EGGS, or _desiccated eggs_, as they are usually called, can be kept for an indefinite length of time without special care in storage, when they are wholesome and carefully handled. Tests that have been made show that eggs of this kind give fairly good results when used in cookery, but they are used principally by bakers, for they can be obtained more cheaply than fresh eggs, especially when it is difficult to secure eggs in other forms. HOME PRESERVATION OF EGGS 31. The housewife who desires to run her household on an economical basis will not depend entirely on eggs that are commercially stored, but will take advantage of one of the many methods by which eggs may be successfully kept in the home. By being prudent in this matter, she will be prepared to supply her family with this commodity at times when the market price is high. As many as twenty household methods have been tried out for the preserving of eggs, but each one is based on the theory that decay is hindered when the shell is covered with some substance that renders it air-tight and prevents evaporation or the entrance of bacteria and mold. Among the methods that have met with the most success are burying eggs in oats, bran, or salt; rubbing them with fat; dipping them in melted paraffin; covering them with varnish or shellac; and putting them down in lime water or in a solution of water glass. No matter which of these methods is adopted, however, it will be well to note that only eggs laid in April, May, or June should be used for storage purposes, as these are the best ones laid during the year; also, that the eggs should always be packed with the small end down, because the yolk will not settle toward the small end so readily as toward the large end or the side. 32. Of these various ways of preserving eggs in the home, probably the oldest method is that of packing the eggs in oats, bran, or salt. This method is fairly effective, but the eggs preserved by it do not keep so long as eggs preserved by other methods, nor is their quality so good. Preserving eggs by completely covering the shells with fat, vaseline, paraffin, varnish, or other substance that will exclude the air but not impart flavor to the eggs, proves a more satisfactory method so far as the eggs are concerned, but it requires more time and handling. To assist in their preservation, eggs are sometimes immersed in boiling water for 12 to 15 seconds. This process, which causes the white to harden slightly just inside of the shell, keeps the eggs fairly well, but it is rather difficult to accomplish, as the least overcooking renders the egg unfit for use as a raw egg. As a result of many trials, it has been found that putting eggs down in the various solutions that are used for this purpose is the most effective way of preserving them under home conditions, provided, of course, the solutions in which the eggs are immersed do not flavor the eggs. Therefore, to assist the housewife, detailed directions for using lime water and water glass for this purpose are here given. 33. PRESERVATION WITH LIMEWATER.--To prepare limewater for the preservation of eggs, dissolve 1 pound or 1 pint of salt and 1 quart of finely slaked lime in 3 gallons of water, stir the solution at frequent intervals for a day or two, and then allow the liquid to settle. Place the eggs in tall stone crocks or kegs with their pointed ends turned down, filling the receptacles to within a few inches of the top. Pour the clear limewater over the eggs so arranged, allowing it to rise an inch or two above the top layer. Then stand the vessel in a cool place where the temperature will not exceed 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Eggs so treated will keep for at least 6 or 8 months. The only objection to this plan is that the eggs preserved by it sometimes acquire a slight lime taste. 34. PRESERVATION WITH WATER GLASS.--Putting eggs down in a solution of water glass is without doubt the most satisfactory method of storing them in the home. So effective does this method prove that the housewife who has a convenient and proper storage room should not fail to take advantage of this way of laying up a supply of eggs. The commercial form of water glass is usually a mixture of potassium and sodium silicate, which, besides being cheaper than that which is chemically pure, is the kind that is preferred for the purpose of preserving eggs. A good quality of it either in a sirup-like solution or in the form of a powder retails in drug or grocery stores for about 10 cents a pound. To make a solution of the desired strength to preserve eggs satisfactorily, dissolve 1 part of water glass in 7 parts of warm water that has first been boiled to drive off bacteria, mold, spores, etc. One quart of water glass will make sufficient solution to cover about 12 dozen eggs. With the solution thoroughly mixed, it is ready to pour over the eggs. In selecting eggs for the purpose of storing, be careful to choose only those which are clean, fresh, and perfectly sound, and, if possible, infertile. It is advisable not to wash them before they are put into the preservative, for they will keep better if their bloom is not removed. Place the eggs in receptacles in the manner explained for preserving eggs in limewater, and over them pour the water-glass solution until they are all covered. If the eggs so prepared are stored in a cool place, they will keep as long as those preserved in limewater; besides, there will be no danger of their acquiring any foreign flavor. * * * * * COOKING OF EGGS PRELIMINARY PREPARATION 35. The successful preparation of eggs for their use as a food demands that certain points must be observed by the housewife. For instance, she must see that the eggs she uses are in the right condition; that the shells are properly broken for the most convenient removal of the egg; that the parts of the egg are separated in the right way in case the whites and the yolks are to be used separately; and that the eggs receive the right treatment for the purpose for which they are to be used. Attention to all these points not only will insure the most satisfactory results, but will enable the housewife to supply her family with food that is extremely wholesome and nutritious. [Illustration: FIG. 7] 36. Exterior Condition of Eggs.--As has been explained, clean eggs are the most desirable, but it is not advisable to wash eggs that are to be kept for even a short time, as washing them removes the natural coating that helps to prevent the entrance of bacteria. However, as it is necessary that the shells be perfectly clean before they are broken or before the eggs are cooked, the eggs may be washed or wiped with a damp cloth immediately before such processes. 37. BREAKING OF EGGS.--In cookery, it is usually desirable to break an egg shell so that the yolk will not run into the white; that is, so that these can be kept separate. While there are several methods of doing this, the housewife should adopt the one that is most convenient for her. A quick method that is often employed consists in striking the shell on the edge of the pan or the bowl into which the contents are to be put. A preferable method, however, is illustrated in Fig. 7. It consists in striking one side of the shell, midway between the ends, a sharp blow with the edge of a knife. The advantage of this method will be evident after a trial or two, for it will be found that the depth of the cut made by the knife can be so gauged that there will be little danger of breaking the yolk. Besides, fragments of the shell are not likely to fall into the bowl or the pan with the contents of the egg. [Illustration: FIG. 8] 38. SEPARATING OF EGGS.--Frequently recipes require that the yolks and whites of eggs be beaten separately before being added to the other ingredients. When this is the case, care must be exercised in taking the egg from the shell. The method by which this is most easily accomplished is illustrated in Fig. 8. As will be observed, the shell is first broken as nearly as possible into halves and then, while the egg is poured from 1/2 of the shell into the other, the white is dropped into a dish and the yolk is retained in the shell. During this process, the yolk should remain intact in its delicate membrane, for if it becomes mixed with the white the lightness of the white will be injured. To separate the yolk from the white is not difficult when eggs are fresh, but as they become stale the membrane surrounding the yolk grows weak and breaks easily. If the yolk breaks and any of it falls into the white, it must be completely removed before the white is beaten. 39. BEATING OF EGGS.--Sometimes eggs are cooked in the shell and other times they are used alone just as they are removed from the shell, as in the frying and poaching processes; however, when they are to be combined with other ingredients, they are usually beaten. Eggs are beaten for the purpose of mixing the yolk and the white or of incorporating air to act as a leavening agent when the eggs are heated in the cooking process. Various utensils, such as a fork, an egg whip, or an egg beater, may be employed for beating eggs, the one to select depending on the use to which the eggs are to be put. The rotary, or Dover, egg beater, previously described as a labor-saving device and illustrated in Fig. 9 (_a_), should be used to beat either whole eggs or the yolks of eggs when they are to be used in custards, mayonnaise, cakes, puddings, etc., as it will beat them sufficiently light for such purposes. However, for the beating of egg whites, use should be made of a fork or of an egg whip similar to that shown in (_b_), because the whites must be lifted instead of stirred for the incorporation of air, and it is only with a utensil of this kind that this can be accomplished. Then, too, more air can be incorporated into the whites and the volume of the egg thereby increased by means of a fork or an egg whip than by an egg beater. An important point to remember in this connection is that eggs can be beaten more successfully when they are cold and have had a pinch of salt added to them. [Illustration: FIG. 9] [Illustration: FIG. 10] 40. In the beating of eggs, it should be remembered that for some purposes, as in making some kinds of sponge cake, they are beaten until nearly frothy, as shown in Fig. 10, when they do not stand up nor cling to the whip; whereas, for other purposes, as in making meringue, they are beaten until they are stiff enough to stand up well and to adhere to the whip, as Fig. 11 shows. When egg whites are to be beaten stiff, care should be taken not to continue the beating too long. If this is done, they will become dry and will break up into small pieces, a condition that will mean a loss of some of the air that has been incorporated. It is well also to observe that egg whites should always be beaten in the same direction and that the same motion should be continued throughout the beating, for a change of direction or motion always causes a loss of air. A final precaution to take is never to allow egg whites to stand after they are beaten. If this is done, the leavening power of the eggs is reduced, because the air soon escapes from beaten eggs and leaves underneath them a clear liquid that can never be beaten up. For instance, eggs that are to be used for boiled icing should not be beaten until the sirup has finished boiling. However, eggs that have been separated but not beaten may stand for a couple of hours, provided they are covered and kept in a cool place. [Illustration: FIG. 11] POINTS TO OBSERVE IN COOKING EGGS 41. As has been previously stated, the substance in eggs that requires special care in the cooking process is the protein, which occurs in this food in the form of albumen. Because of this, certain points concerning the treatment that the albumen requires should be kept in mind. In a raw egg, the albumen occurs in a semiliquid form, but it coagulates at a lower temperature than does the yolk, which contains a high percentage of fat. After coagulation, the consistency of the two parts is very different. The white is elastic and more or less tough, while the yolk, upon being thoroughly cooked, becomes powdery, or mealy, and breaks up into minute particles. The egg white begins to coagulate at 134 degrees Fahrenheit, and it becomes white and jellylike at 160 degrees. Bringing an egg to such a temperature produces a more desirable result than cooking it at a high temperature--boiling point, for instance--because the albumen, instead of becoming tough, as it does at a high temperature, acquires a soft, tender consistency that exists throughout the entire egg. An egg cooked in this way is more digestible and appetizing than one that is boiled until it becomes hard and tough. 42. The low temperature at which eggs will cook in the shell applies also to eggs when they are combined with other foods. Sometimes, however, a mixture in which eggs are one of the ingredients must be cooked at a high temperature because the materials mixed with them require it. This difficulty can be overcome when eggs are combined with starchy foods, such as corn starch, rice, and tapioca, that require long cooking. In such a case, all the ingredients except the eggs may be cooked the length of time they require, after which the eggs may be added so that they will cook just long enough to become coagulated. Longer cooking is liable to spoil the texture. Often the starchy mixture retains sufficient heat to set the eggs without further cooking after they are added. 43. A very nutritious way in which to prepare eggs when they are to be used for a dessert is to combine them with milk to form a custard, which, after being sweetened and flavored, is baked. The proportion that has been accepted as ideal to produce a dessert of the right thickness is one egg to each cupful of milk; however, an entire egg is not always required, as one yolk is often sufficient to thicken 1 cupful of milk. Care should be taken in the cooking of such custards, for if they are cooked too long or at too high a temperature they will curdle and whey; whereas, a properly cooked custard--that is, one cooked slowly at a low temperature and for the required length of time--will have a smooth, jellylike consistency. A slight variation in a dish of this kind is secured by reducing the number of eggs and thickening it with corn starch or some other starchy material. While such a mixture is not a true custard, it makes an excellent dessert. 44. In the cooking of mixtures containing eggs, no utensil proves quite so satisfactory as the double boiler, which has already been explained and illustrated. In fact, it is almost impossible to cook an egg mixture directly over the flame on account of the difficulty encountered in preventing the eggs from curdling. The low temperature at which cooking is possible in the double boiler makes it a comparatively simple matter to bring a mixture to the proper consistency without the formation of curds. Still, a certain amount of precaution must be taken even with a double boiler. If the degree of heat that is reached in this utensil is applied too long, the result will be no more satisfactory than when mixtures are exposed directly to the heat and cooked at a high temperature. While every effort should be made to cook mixtures containing eggs, such as custards or mayonnaise, so as to prevent curds from forming, occasionally they will form in spite of all that can be done. However, it is sometimes possible to remedy the matter by placing the vessel at once in cold water and beating the mixture rapidly with a Dover egg beater until the curds disappear. The cold water cools the mixture and prevents the formation of more curds, and the beating breaks up those which have already formed, provided they are not too hard. 45. In addition to the uses already mentioned, eggs have numerous other uses in cooking with which the housewife should be familiar. For instance, slightly beaten egg is used to a great extent to make crumbs or meal adhere to the surface of croquettes, meat, oysters, etc. that are to be saut\\u00e9d or fried in deep fat, a coating of this kind preventing the food from becoming soaked with grease. In addition, egg is used to stick flour together for certain kinds of dough, such as noodles. Then, again, it is much used to puff up mixtures and produce a hollow space in them, as in popovers and cream puffs. While such mixtures do not require beating, spongy mixtures, such as omelets and sponge cakes, do. In these, eggs are an important factor, and they must be thoroughly beaten in order to incorporate the air in small bubbles and thus produce the desired texture. SERVING OF EGGS 46. The manner of serving eggs depends, of course, on the way in which they are cooked. One point, however, that should never be overlooked, so far as eggs that are to be served hot is concerned, is that they should be served immediately upon being prepared, so that they will not have an opportunity to become cool before being eaten. This applies particularly to any spongy mixture, such as puff omelet and souffl\\u00e9, as these dishes shrink upon standing and become less appetizing in both appearance and texture. Several ways of serving soft-cooked eggs are in practice, but probably the most satisfactory way is to serve them in egg cups. In case cups are used, they should be heated before being placed on the table, as the heat that they retain helps to keep the eggs warm. The eggs may be removed from the shell into the cup and eaten from the cup, or the unbroken egg may be placed point downwards in the small end of the cup, a small piece broken from the broad end of the shell, and the egg then eaten from the shell through the opening made in it. If egg cups are not available, the eggs may be removed from the shell and served in small dessert dishes, which also should be heated. Many egg dishes are made more attractive and appetizing by means of a garnish of some kind. Small strips or triangular pieces of toast, sprays of parsley, celery leaves, lettuce, and strips of pimiento are very satisfactory for this purpose. If no other garnish is desired, just a sprinkling of paprika adds a touch of color. 47. In connection with the serving of eggs it will be well to note that they have a tendency to adhere to china and to discolor silver. Therefore, in the washing of china and the cleaning of silver that have been used in the serving of raw or slightly cooked eggs, much care should be exercised. Dishes in which eggs of this kind have been served should first be washed in cool water in order to remove all the egg, and then they should be thoroughly washed in hot water. If the hot water is applied first, the heat will cause the egg to coagulate and cling to the dishes. Silver that comes in contact with eggs tarnishes or becomes discolored through the action of the sulphur that is found in them, just as it does when it is exposed to the air. Dark spots that appear on silver from this source may be removed by means of a good silver cleaner. EGG RECIPES 48. To enable the housewife to prepare many of the dishes already mentioned, as well as many other egg dishes, a number of recipes are here given. These recipes pertain to the cooking of eggs alone in various ways or to dishes in which eggs are the leading ingredient. There are, of course, numerous other dishes in which eggs are required, such as custards, cakes, mayonnaise, etc., but these are omitted here, as recipes for them are included in the lessons that pertain directly to them. In the first few recipes, the ingredients are omitted and merely directions given, for the eggs themselves are practically the only thing required, especially so far as the cooking is concerned. However, in the majority of cases, the ingredients are listed in the usual manner and explicit directions then given for carrying out the recipe. 49. SOFT-COOKED, OR JELLIED, EGGS.--Eggs that are cooked soft, or jellied, may be used for any meal in which plain eggs can be served. When properly prepared, they are both digestible and attractive, and any person who is able to eat eggs at all can eat them in this form. To prepare soft-cooked, or jellied, eggs, first bring to the boiling point sufficient water to cover well the desired number of eggs, which is usually 1 pint of water to each egg. Then drop the eggs into the water carefully, remove the pan from the fire, place a cover on it, and set it on the back of the stove, where the water will not heat further nor cool too rapidly. Allow the eggs to remain in the water for 5 minutes. When eggs cooked in this manner are served, they will be found to be the consistency of jelly all the way through. This method of cooking is preferable to boiling them for 3, 4, or 5 minutes, because boiling cooks the white just inside the shell very hard, while the yolk of the egg remains liquid. 50. POACHED EGGS.--Eggs properly poached make a very attractive breakfast dish, but the poaching should be well done in order to have the dish attractive and digestible. The food value of a plain poached egg is, of course, identically the same as that of a soft-cooked, a hard-cooked, or a raw egg. Eggs are usually poached in a shallow pan, although egg poachers are to be had. To poach eggs in a shallow pan, pour into the pan sufficient water to cover the eggs that are to be cooked, add a teaspoonful of salt or of vinegar for each pint of water, and bring it to the boiling point. Remove the pan from the flame or reduce the heat so that the water will cease to boil. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer and then slide them carefully into the water. Do not allow the water to boil after the eggs have been added, as boiling toughens the egg white and in addition causes considerable loss by tearing it into shreds. When the eggs are set, remove them carefully from the water and season them with salt and pepper. A convenient way to remove the eggs is to use a large spoon that has holes in the bowl for draining off the water. The salt or vinegar is added to the water before cooking in order to solidify the albumen and keep it in a mass. [Illustration: Fig. 12] An egg poacher contains a perforated section of metal just large enough to hold an egg. In poaching eggs with such a utensil, the perforated part is placed over a pan of boiling water; then the egg is carefully slid into it, and allowed to poach. Eggs prepared in this way are really cooked by steam and are found to be very satisfactory. 51. POACHED EGGS ON TOAST.--Eggs poached according to the directions just given can be made both appetizing and attractive by serving them on toast, as shown in Fig. 12; indeed, the addition of toast to a poached egg adds a quantity of carbohydrate, a food principle in which the egg is lacking. If the toast is buttered, fat is added, and such a dish, together with fruit, makes a very excellent breakfast. A slice of toast of medium size with the usual amount of butter and egg will have a food value of about 225 calories. In preparing poached eggs on toast, the usual custom is to butter slices of freshly made toast, moisten them with hot milk or cream, and place on them freshly poached eggs. The eggs are then seasoned with salt and pepper, and, if desired, a little piece of butter may be dropped on each one. To add to the attractiveness of such a dish, the toast may be cut round with a cookie cutter or a square piece may be cut diagonally to make two triangular pieces. 52. HARD-COOKED EGGS.--Eggs that are cooked hard may be served hot or cold, or they may be used in numerous ways, as, for example, to garnish a dish to which the addition of protein is desirable or to supply a high-protein dish for some light meal. To prepare hard-cooked eggs, bring to the boiling point sufficient water to cover well the desired number of eggs, about 1 pint of water for each egg to be cooked usually being sufficient. Carefully drop the eggs into the water and place the pan on the back of the stove where the water will not boil, but will stay hot. Allow the eggs to remain in the hot water for 45 minutes; then remove them, and if they are desired hot, serve them at once. If they are not to be served hot, pour cold water over them and allow them to cool before removing the shells in order to prevent the yolks from discoloring. When prepared in this way, eggs will be found to be tender and at the same time well cooked; whereas, if they are cooked at the boiling point, they are certain to be tough and leathery and consequently less digestible. 53. FRIED EGGS.--Fried eggs are likely to be more or less indigestible, because the hot fat coagulates the protein and makes it very hard. The addition of fat, however, increases the food value of the eggs to a certain extent. To fry eggs, melt enough butter or other fat in a frying pan to cover its surface well. Break the eggs one at a time into a saucer and slip them into the hot fat. Season with salt and pepper. Fry until the white has become well solidified on the bottom, and then either turn them over or put a few drops of water in the pan and cover it tight with a cover, so that the steam will cook the top of the egg. Fry until the desired degree of hardness has been obtained, and then serve. 54. SCRAMBLED EGGS.--A pleasing variety from the usual methods of preparation is offered by means of scrambled eggs, which are not difficult to make. Too long cooking, however, should be guarded against, for it will cause the protein in the eggs to become too hard and to separate from the liquid and will produce watery scrambled eggs. To be most satisfactory, they should be taken from the pan just before they have finished cooking, for the heat that they hold will complete it. Eggs prepared in this way, according to the accompanying recipe, may be served on toast or with ham and bacon. If they are served with meat, a smaller portion of meat should be given to a person than is ordinarily served. SCRAMBLED EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 3/4 c. milk 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. butter Beat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk and seasonings. Melt the butter in a frying pan and, when the butter is hot, pour the egg mixture into it. As the eggs begin to thicken, stir them up from the bottom of the pan and continue to stir them until the entire mass has thickened slightly. Before the eggs are entirely cooked, remove them from the pan. Bacon and ham fat may be used instead of butter, and they are strongly recommended if they can be secured, for they lend an excellent flavor to scrambled eggs. 55. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATO.--The addition of tomato to scrambled eggs lends an unusual flavor as well as a little variety to the dish. The same conditions apply to the cooking of scrambled eggs with tomato as apply to plain scrambled eggs; namely, that too long cooking ruins them. The onion included in the recipe here given may be omitted from the dish if it is not desirable. The fat to be used may be in the form of butter, although bacon or ham fat may be substituted to give an agreeable flavor. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATO (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 Tb. fat 1 slice onion 1 c. stewed tomatoes 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 6 eggs Put the fat into a frying pan, and when this grease is hot add the slice of onion and fry it until it is brown. Remove the onion from the fat, and add the stewed tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Then beat the eggs slightly and add them to the hot tomato. Stir the mixture slowly from the bottom of the pan until it is slightly thickened. Remove from the pan and serve hot. 56. SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST.--The addition of cheese to eggs, as in the accompanying recipe, makes a dish that is very high in protein and usually pleasing in flavor. So as not to overcook the eggs in this dish, they should be cooked only slightly in the pan, because they receive additional cooking when the dish is placed in the oven to melt the cheese. Browning the cheese slightly on top makes a very attractive dish, especially when garnished with parsley. SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 3/4 c. milk 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. fat 1/2 c. grated cheese 6 slices of toast Beat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk, salt, and pepper. Melt the fat in a frying pan, and when it is hot add the egg mixture. Stir the mixture as it cooks until it has thickened slightly; then pour it over the slices of toast placed in a shallow pan. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top, and place under a lighted broiler or in a very hot oven until the cheese melts. Remove to a platter garnish with parsley, and serve. 57. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM.--The accompanying recipe affords an excellent way in which to use up the little scraps of ham that may be cut from the bone when it is impossible to cut enough nice looking pieces to serve as a cold dish. Eggs prepared in this way will be found very tasty and will take the place of a meat dish for luncheon or supper. SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 1 c. milk 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1 c. chopped cooked ham 2 Tb. fat Beat the eggs slightly, and to them add the milk, salt, pepper, and ham. Melt the fat in a frying pan and scramble the mixture as directed in Art. 54 until it is slightly thickened. Remove from the stove and serve at once. If desired, this dish may be served on toast. Other left-over meat, such as roast beef or pork, may be used in place of ham, but such meats do not make so tasty a dish, the flavor of ham in such a combination being more desirable. 58. PLAIN OMELET.--The simplest type of omelet, which is known as plain omelet, does not differ materially from scrambled eggs, except that the whole is collected in a mass in an omelet shape. No difficulty will be experienced in making such an omelet if the directions in the recipe here given are followed explicitly. To make this dish more attractive, some food of a contrasting color, such as jelly or tomatoes, may be used for garnishing. PLAIN OMELET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 6 Tb. water 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 3 Tb. fat Beat the eggs, and to them add the water, salt, and pepper. Heat the fat in an omelet pan or a small frying pan, and when it is hot add the egg mixture. When the egg on the bottom of the pan has thickened, tip the pan and draw the thickened portion toward the handle with the end of a knife, allowing the uncooked egg to run over the pan, and when that has thickened on the bottom, draw it up as before. Repeat until all of the egg has been cooked and an oblong-shaped omelet is formed. Place on a hot platter or plate, garnish with parsley or jelly, and serve. [Illustration: FIG. 13] 59. PUFF OMELET.--Many housewives consider it to be a very difficult thing to make a puff omelet successfully; but such need not be the case if fresh eggs are used and the usual amount of care is taken in its preparation. The whites of the eggs must not be over-beaten, as too much beating will cause the loss of air and will not permit the omelet to become sufficiently light. Another precaution is that the mixture should not be overcooked, for the application of heat after it has been sufficiently cooked will cause it to shrink. How a puff omelet made according to the recipe here given should look, is shown in Fig. 13. This is a very pleasing dish and never fails to appeal to those persons who are fond of eggs. PUFF OMELET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 Tb. bread crumbs 4 Tb. milk 4 eggs 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 3 Tb. fat Soak the bread crumbs in the milk. Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs. Beat the egg yolks and add them to the crumbs and milk. Add the salt and pepper. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them carefully into the yolk mixture. Heat the fat in an omelet pan or a frying pan, and when it is hot pour the mixture into it. Cook over a very slow fire, being careful not to burn the mixture, until a knife can be slipped under and the whole mixture raised. By this time the top should be quite puffed up. Place the pan in a hot oven, where the omelet should puff still more, and cook until it is no longer raw. With a knife, score across through the center on a straight line with the handle. Then carefully fold the omelet double, roll it out on a hot platter or plate, as shown in Fig. 14, garnish with parsley, and serve at once. If an omelet of this kind stands for any length of time after it is served, it will shrink and be much less appetizing. [Illustration: FIG. 14] 60. CHEESE OMELET.--If an additional amount of protein in the form of casein is desired in an omelet, the accompanying recipe for cheese omelet should be tried. The addition of cheese makes this dish even a better meat substitute than either the plain or the puff omelet. Likewise, the cheese adds flavor, which may be increased if desired by the addition of more cheese than the recipe calls for. Although this recipe mentions butter, fat other than butter may be used. CHEESE OMELET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1/2 c. grated cheese 2 Tb. bread crumbs 4 Tb. milk 4 eggs 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 3 Tb. butter Mix the grated cheese with the bread crumbs, milk, egg yolks, salt, and pepper. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and fold them into the other ingredients. To cook the omelet, proceed according to the directions given for making puff omelet in Art. 59. 61. TOMATO OMELET.--The addition of tomatoes to an omelet makes an attractive dish as far as color is concerned, and, at the same time, it gives variety by improving the flavor. Such an omelet is also less concentrated than a plain omelet, for the tomatoes provide bulk and additional water is added. While in a way these lower the food value of the dish, the loss is more than made up by the qualities that are added. TOMATO OMELET (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 1/2 c. milk 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 3 Tb. fat 2 medium-sized ripe tomatoes Beat the eggs, and to them add the milk, salt, and pepper. Heat the fat in a pan large enough to make the egg mixture 1/2 inch deep when poured into it. Cook slowly until it is well done. Peel and cut the tomatoes into slices 1/3 inch thick. Place the sliced tomatoes on 1/2 of the omelet, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, score the omelet through the center, and fold the other half over the tomatoes. Then slide the omelet on a hot platter, garnish with lettuce or parsley, and serve at once. 62. VARIETY IN OMELETS.--From the recipes given for omelets, it will be noted that this dish may be made plain or may be varied by adding ingredients that provide flavoring or increase the nutritive value. In addition to the suggestions that have been made in these recipes, there is an almost endless number of ways in which omelets may be varied. For instance, left-over bits of any kind of meat, such as a roast, a steak, or chops, from the day before or bits of bacon fried for a previous meal may be chopped fine and utilized for this purpose. Cheese cut fine or grated and mixed with the eggs helps to make a delicious omelet. Bread crumbs, cracker crumbs, rice, riced potatoes, or left-over cereal may be used, as well as mushrooms, chopped or whole, and oysters raw or previously scalloped or fried and then chopped. Bits of fish, such as left-over crab or lobster, will do nicely for increasing variety. Often jelly, jam, and fruit or vegetables are folded inside after the omelet is cooked. 63. STUFFED EGGS.--A highly seasoned cold dish that is delicious for picnics or cold lunches can be made by removing the yolks from hard-cooked eggs, seasoning them, and then stuffing them into the whites, as is explained in the recipe here given. Eggs so prepared also make a desirable high-protein dish for summer weather when meat dishes fail to appeal to the appetite. Wafers or tiny bread-and-butter sandwiches served with stuffed eggs make them more attractive. STUFFED EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 hard-cooked eggs 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1/8 tsp. paprika 1/2 tsp. mustard 2 Tb. vinegar Cut the eggs in half, either lengthwise or crosswise. Remove the yolks, mash them, add to them the salt, pepper, paprika, mustard, and vinegar, and mix thoroughly. Fill the egg whites with the yolk mixture. The eggs will be much more appetizing in appearance if the yolk is not packed smoothly back into the white but allowed to stand up roughly. The plate on which the eggs are served should be nicely garnished with lettuce, parsley, or celery leaves. [Illustration: FIG. 15] 64. CREAMED EGGS.--If a dish that will serve well for luncheon or a light supper is desired, creamed eggs, as illustrated in Fig. 15, will be found very satisfactory, for the cream sauce that is served on them and the toast on which the eggs are placed add carbohydrate to an otherwise high-protein dish. The eggs used in this dish must be hard-cooked in water, so as not to be indigestible. Paprika sprinkled over the top and parsley used as a garnish add colors that make the dish very attractive. CREAMED EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1-1/2 c. milk 2 Tb. fat 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. paprika 6 hard-cooked eggs 6 slices of toast Heat the milk. Put the fat in a saucepan and heat it until it is light brown; then add the flour, salt, and paprika to the melted fat and mix all thoroughly. Pour in the hot milk and stir the mixture constantly until the sauce has become smooth and thick. Cut the hard-cooked eggs into halves while they are hot, and place two halves with the cut sides down on each piece of toast. Pour the white sauce over all, sprinkle with paprika, and serve. [Illustration: FIG. 16] 65. Eggs \\u00e0 la Goldenrod.--Closely resembling creamed eggs in composition and food value, but differing from them somewhat in appearance, are eggs \\u00e0 la goldenrod, which are illustrated in Fig. 16. This is, perhaps, even a more attractive dish if it is nicely made than creamed eggs, and many persons who do not like hard-cooked eggs find this dish agreeable and are able to digest it. EGGS \\u00c0 LA GOLDENROD (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. milk 2 Tb. fat 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 4 hard-cooked eggs 6 slices of toast Heat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add the flour, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Then add the hot milk and stir until the sauce thickens. Chop the whites of the hard-cooked eggs into small pieces, and mix them with the white sauce. Arrange the toast on a platter and pour the sauce over it. Put the hard-cooked egg yolks through a sieve or a ricer and sprinkle them on top of the white sauce. Serve hot. 66. SCALLOPED EGGS.--A quantity of carbohydrate is added to eggs when they are scalloped, for the white sauce and the cracker crumbs that are used in this dish supply this food substance. The cold meat that this dish requires and that should be well chopped into small pieces may be left-over from roasted, stewed, or even broiled meat. As this provides an additional amount of protein, the dish on the whole serves as an excellent substitute for meat with carbohydrate added. SCALLOPED EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. milk 2 Tb. fat 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. flour 1 c. cracker crumbs 4 hard-cooked eggs 1 c. chopped cold meat Heat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add the salt, pepper, and flour, and mix well. To this add the hot milk. Cook until the sauce thickens, stirring constantly. Grease a baking dish and place in it 1/3 cupful of the cracker crumbs. Over the crumbs arrange two of the eggs sliced thinly, and on the top of the eggs put half of the meat. Repeat by adding a layer of 1/3 cupful of the crumbs, the remaining eggs sliced, and the remainder of the meat. Pour the white sauce over all and arrange the remaining 1/3 cupful of crumbs on top. Bake in a moderate oven for 1/2 hour. Serve hot from the baking dish. 67. INDIVIDUAL BAKING DISHES FOR EGG RECIPES.--Although the directions given in the preceding recipe for scalloped eggs state that this recipe is baked in a baking dish, it is not necessary that one large dish of this kind be used, for, if desired, individual baking dishes may be substituted. In fact, any recipe for which a large baking dish would ordinarily be used may be baked in the small dishes used for a single serving, and eggs prepared in this way are especially attractive. Such dishes are also used for the baking of custards or the molding of jelly and blanc mange. Since they prove very useful and find so much favor, it is advisable for every housewife to add a few of them to her supply of utensils and to become familiar with the varieties that can be secured and the proper way to use them. Dishes of this kind may be purchased in both cheap and expensive varieties and in plain or fancy styles, being made of white porcelain, of glass, or of the brown ware so much used for large baking dishes and casseroles and having a white glazing on the inside. 68. When such dishes are used as a means of adding variety to the cooking and serving of eggs, they should be placed in the oven in a shallow pan containing enough hot water to come nearly to the top of them. The object of this plan is to keep the temperature uniform. As long as the dishes are surrounded by water, the food to be cooked will not attain a greater heat than 212 degrees Fahrenheit, because the surrounding water cannot reach a higher temperature. Food cooked in this way will be found to be baked much more evenly and to be of a better consistency than food that is subjected to the high temperature of the oven. Most of the recipes that follow, while they can be baked in large baking dishes if desired and then served from the dish, are designed particularly to be used in individual baking dishes. 69. BAKED EGGS IN CREAM.--A dish that is particularly desirable for breakfast, but that may be served for luncheon, is made by baking eggs in cream according to the accompanying recipe. Besides being very appetizing, this dish is high in food value because of the addition of the cream and fat. Crisp toast served with eggs prepared in this way is very delightful. BAKED EGGS IN CREAM (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 eggs 1 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 3/4 c. cream Grease six individual baking dishes and break an egg into each. Put a small piece of butter on top of each egg and season with salt and pepper. Pour over each egg two tablespoonfuls of cream. Place the baking dishes in a shallow pan of hot water and bake until the eggs are as hard as desired. Serve hot. 70. SHIRRED EGGS WITH HAM.--An excellent way in which to utilize scraps of ham is to combine them with eggs to make a dish that may be served in place of meat. This dish, besides being high in food value, is very tasty because of the flavor of the ham and the fact that it is quite highly seasoned. SHIRRED EGGS WITH HAM (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1/2 tsp. prepared mustard 1/4 tsp. pepper 1 c. chopped ham 6 eggs 1/4 tsp. salt 1 Tb. butter Grease six individual baking dishes. Mix the mustard and pepper with the ham, and then divide this mixture as evenly as possible into the baking dishes. Break an egg on top of the ham in each dish, season with salt, and put a small piece of butter on each. Place the dishes in a shallow pan of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are well set or hardened. Remove from the oven and serve at once. 71. EGG SOUFFL\\u00c9.--If a delicate dish for children or invalids is desired, egg souffl\\u00e9 will answer the purpose very well. This dish is light in character, but it is high in protein and to most persons is very delightful. It is more attractive if baked in individual baking dishes, but it may be baked in a large baking dish and served directly from the dish. To improve the flavor of egg souffl\\u00e9 and make it a more appetizing dish, tomato sauce is often served with it. EGG SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1 c. milk 2 Tb. fat 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt 1 Tb. chopped parsley 4 eggs Heat the milk. Brown the fat in a saucepan, add to it the flour, salt, and parsley, and mix well. Pour in the hot milk, stir constantly until the sauce thickens, and then remove from the fire. Separate the eggs and add the well-beaten yolks to the sauce, stirring rapidly so that the egg will not curd. Beat the whites stiff and fold them carefully into the sauce. Turn into well-greased individual baking dishes until they are about two-thirds full, place in a shallow pan of hot water, and bake until firm when touched with the finger. Serve at once in the dishes in which they are baked, because they shrink when they are allowed to cool. 72. The tomato sauce that is often served with egg souffl\\u00e9 is made as follows: TOMATO SAUCE 1 1/2 c. strained stewed tomatoes 2 Tb. fat 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. flour Force enough stewed tomatoes through a sieve to make 1 1/2 cupfuls of strained tomato. Heat the strained tomato and to it add the fat, salt, and pepper. Moisten the flour with a little cold water and add it to the hot tomato. Cook for 5 minutes. Serve over the souffl\\u00e9. [Illustration: FIG. 17] 73. Alpine Eggs.--It is rather unusual to combine cream or cottage cheese with eggs, so that when this is done, as in the accompanying recipe, a dish that is out of the ordinary is the result. If not a sufficient amount of cottage cheese is in supply to serve for a meal, it may very well be used for this dish. Otherwise, cream cheese serves nicely. ALPINE EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 10-cent pkgs. cream cheese or 1 c. cottage cheese 2 Tb. finely chopped parsley 1/8 tsp. paprika 6 eggs 1 Tb. butter 1 1/2 tsp. salt Grease six individual baking dishes. Break up the cheese with a fork and sprinkle a layer on the bottom of each dish. Break an egg in each dish over the cheese. Season with salt. Sprinkle a layer of cheese on top of the egg, and over that put chopped parsley, paprika, and a small piece of butter. Place the baking dishes in a shallow pan of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are set. Remove from the oven and serve at once. 74. Clipped Eggs.--The chief value of clipped eggs is their appearance, which, as will be observed in Fig. 17, is very attractive. This dish adds much to the breakfast tray of an invalid or will tempt the appetite of a child who does not feel like eating. But in addition to being attractive, this dish is high in food value, for in this respect it is exactly equivalent to a poached egg on toast or a plain egg served with a piece of toast to which is added a small amount of butter. CLIPPED EGGS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 pieces toast 3 Tb. butter 6 eggs 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper Butter the toast with some of the butter. Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs without breaking the yolks. Beat the whites stiff, and put a mound of the beaten white on top of each piece of buttered toast. Make a hole in the center of the mound of egg white and drop the unbroken yolk into it. Season each with salt and pepper and bits of the remaining butter. Place in a hot oven and bake until the yolk is set and the white slightly browned. Serve hot. 75. LEFT-OVER EGGS.--It is not a difficult matter to utilize eggs in any form in which they may be left over, for they combine readily with many other foods. For instance, left-over hard-cooked eggs may be sliced or chopped and used to garnish dishes of vegetables, meat, fish, or salads. Eggs cooked in this way may also be stuffed according to the recipe given in Art. 63, or they may be crushed and mixed with seasoning for sandwiches. If any soft-cooked eggs remain after a meal, they should be hard-cooked in order to be used to the best advantage. Left-over omelet or scrambled, poached, or fried eggs may be chopped and added to soups, sauces, or gravies, or combined with small pieces of meat or fish and used with crumbs and white sauce to make a scalloped dish. Even uncooked eggs that are taken from the shells, but that cannot be used at once, need not be wasted if proper care is given to them to prevent the formation of a hard crust over their surface. Such eggs should be put into a dish that will allow as little of the surface as possible to be exposed and should be covered with cold water and kept in a cool place. When they are desired for use, the water should be poured off carefully so as to prevent the loss of any of the egg. BREAKFAST MENU 76. So that a definite idea may be formed of the student's progress in cookery, there is here presented a breakfast menu that is to be prepared and reported on at the same time that the answers to the Examination Questions are sent. This menu is practical and it may be easily prepared, as all the dishes it contains have already been considered. MENU Sliced Bananas Cream of Wheat Graham Muffins Butter Puff Omelet Coffee In most homes, breakfast is a meal that is gathered together with as little thought and preparation as possible. The reason for this is that the housewife feels that she does not wish to rise early enough in the morning to prepare an elaborate menu. Breakfast, however, should be the most attractive meal in the day, because it is one that gives to each member of the family the right start for the day and sustains him until luncheon time. In most cases, a cup of coffee and a slice or two of toast do not start one with a cheerful attitude, nor do they contain sufficient food value to nourish the individual properly. With a little forethought and planning, certain foods may be partly prepared for breakfast the day before. If this is done, the time required for the actual preparation of the breakfast need not be greatly increased. For example, in the accompanying menu, the cream of wheat may be cooked the evening before, the materials for the graham muffins measured, and even the pan in which they are to be baked greased, and the materials for the omelet collected and measured. If all this is done, the preparation necessary in the morning will consist merely of slicing the bananas, reheating the cream of wheat, preparing the coffee, baking the muffins, and making the omelet. While the coffee and cream of wheat are heating or cooking, the oven will be heating, so that when the muffins are mixed it will be ready to bake them; and while these are baking the omelet may be prepared. When this is done, all will be ready to serve. EGGS EXAMINATION QUESTIONS (1) Give a brief description of the physical structure of an egg. (2) (_a_) Why are eggs an important article of diet?

As understood in cookery, VEGETABLES refer to plants or parts of plants that are used as food. Vegetables may consist of the entire plant, as, for example, the beet; the stem, as asparagus and celery; the root, as carrot and turnip; the underground stem, or tuber, as the white potato and onion; the foliage, as cabbage and spinach; the flower of the plant, as cauliflower; the pods, which hold the seeds of the plant or the seeds themselves, as peas and beans; or that which in reality is fruit, although for table use always considered a vegetable, as the tomato and eggplant. 2. Because of this large assortment, vegetables afford the greatest possible variety in flavor, appearance, texture, quality, and food value. They therefore assume a place of very great importance in the diet of individuals and in the plans of the housewife who has all the meals to prepare for her family. In fact, there is scarcely a meal, except breakfast, at which vegetables are not served. For dinner, they form a part or all of each course in the meal, except, perhaps, the dessert, and occasionally they may be used for this. Although two or more vegetables are nearly always served in even a simple meal, the use of vegetables in most households is limited to those few varieties which are especially preferred by the family. As a rule, there are a number of other vegetables that would be very acceptable if prepared in certain appetizing ways. An effort should therefore be made to include all such vegetables in the dietary, for they may be used to decided advantage and at the same time they afford variety in the meals. The constant demand for variety in this food makes acceptable new recipes for the preparation of the vegetables already known and information for the use of the unfamiliar kinds. 3. Great variety also exists in the flavor of vegetables, which they derive from their volatile oils; that is, the oils that evaporate rapidly on exposure to the air. In some cases, the flavor is disagreeably strong and must be dissipated, or driven away, in order to make the vegetables agreeable to the taste and to prevent them from disagreeing with those who eat them. In others, the flavor is very mild, so that unless the vegetables are properly prepared the flavor may be almost lost. When the principles relating to the cooking of vegetables are thoroughly understood, little difficulty will be experienced in preparing them so that the flavor is dissipated or retained as the case may require. 4. The food value of vegetables varies as much as do their form and flavor, some of them having almost no food value, others having a great deal, and the remainder varying between these two extremes. The housewife who wishes to provide economically for her family and at the same time give them food that is best suited to their needs, should learn as much of the composition and food value of the various kinds of vegetables as possible. If, besides acquiring this knowledge, she learns a variety of ways in which to prepare each kind, she will find that it is possible to substitute vegetable dishes for the more expensive foods. For instance, it is often possible to substitute a vegetable dish for a meat dish several times a week, but the composition of the vegetable dish must be such that it will really take the place of the meat dish. 5. That it is possible for adults to live on vegetables alone has been proved by vegetarians; that is, persons who exclude meat from the diet. They have shown that all the elements necessary to build and maintain the human body are contained in vegetables, fruits, and cereals, and also that these elements are in such quantity that it is not necessary to supply them in any other way. Even if it is not desired to use such foods exclusively, as much use should be made of them as possible, for they average a lower cost than the high-protein foods, such as eggs, meat, and milk. The use of vegetables, however, need not be restricted to adults, for when properly prepared they may be included to advantage in the diet of very young children. In fact, children should be trained to eat vegetables of all kinds, for such training not only will enable each one to grow up with a correct appreciation for all edible things, but will make the preparation of meals easier for the housewife. 6. Vegetables should receive great care in their preparation, whether the method involved is simple or complicated. Any of the methods of cookery that call for the application of heat may be applied to them, and in many cases they are served without cooking, merely dressing or seasoning being added. Good vegetables may be ruined by improper preparation, while those which are in excellent condition may be improved by the application of the correct methods in their preparation. Vegetables that are inexpensive but highly nutritious should be used when it is necessary to practice economy, because, when they are properly prepared, they form a valuable addition to a meal. 7. All varieties of vegetables are grown almost universally. This fact, together with the facts that they mature at different times during the season, according to the climate in which they are grown, and that most varieties can be conveniently shipped, makes the season in which certain fresh vegetables can be obtained much longer than it formerly was. For instance, very early in the season, long before it is possible to have beans, peas, and other vegetables in the North, they are shipped from the extreme South, and as the season advances, they mature farther and farther north. Therefore, they may be constantly supplied to the northern markets until the time when they mature in that locality. 8. In order not to waste vegetables and to have them in the best possible condition when they are desired for preparation, every housewife should realize that the selection and care of vegetables are also important matters to consider. The selection must be learned by familiarity with them, as well as practice in buying, and the housewife must be guided by the suitability of the vegetables and the money she has to spend for them. The care that must be given to them is determined by the kinds that are purchased, some requiring one kind of care in storage and others entirely different attention. STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND FOOD VALUE 9. STRUCTURE OF VEGETABLES.--Although vegetables vary greatly in composition and consequently in food value, they are similar so far as physical structure is concerned. In general, they consist of a skeleton framework that is made up of cellulose. Their digestible part is composed of tiny cells having thin walls that confine the actual food material in the form of a liquid or semiliquid. As the vegetables grow old, the cellulose material and the cell walls gradually toughen, with the result that old vegetables are less easily made tender than young ones and are not so agreeable to the taste as those which have not grown hard. The total food value of vegetables, as well as of cereals, meats, and, in fact, all foods, varies with the quantity of water and cellulose they contain. Therefore, the vegetables that contain the least coarse material are the ones that have the highest food value. 10. The green color that characterizes many vegetables is due to a substance called _chlorophyl_. This substance is essential to the normal growth of plants and is present in the correct amount in only those which are properly exposed to the sunlight. Sufficient proof of this is seen in the case of vegetables that form heads, as, for instance, cabbage and head lettuce. As is well known, the outside leaves are green, while the inside ones are practically white. Since it is exposure to the light that produces the green color, a vegetable or plant of any kind can be bleached by merely covering it in order to keep out the sunlight. This procedure also enables the plants to remain more tender than those which have been allowed to grow in the normal way and become green. For instance, the inside leaves of a head of lettuce are always very much more tender than the green outside leaves. In fact, the center of any kind of plant, that is, the leaves and the stem that appear last, are more tender, possess a lighter color, and have a more delicate flavor than the older ones. 11. PROTEIN IN VEGETABLES.--Taken as a whole, vegetables are not high in protein. Some of them contain practically none of this food substance and others contain a comparatively large amount, but the average is rather low. Vegetables that are high in water, such as lettuce, celery, tomatoes, and cucumbers, contain so little protein that the quantity is not appreciable. Such vegetables as potatoes, beets, carrots, etc. contain slightly larger quantities. Dried vegetables, such as beans, peas, and lentils, contain comparatively large amounts of this substance, and for this reason may be substituted for such high-protein foods as meat and fish. 12. The composition of vegetable protein is only slightly different from that of animal protein. In fact, the experiments of scientists show that animal protein may be readily replaced by vegetable protein. One of these proteins is sometimes called _vegetable albumin_, but the chief protein of vegetables containing the largest amount of this substance, namely, beans, peas, and lentils, is called _legumin_, from the term _legumes_, the name of this class of vegetables. It is generally agreed that vegetable protein is not so digestible as animal protein, but this disadvantage is offset by the fact that it does not bring about so much intestinal trouble as does the protein of animal foods and is less likely to cause disturbances that are usually attributed to foods high in this substance. Vegetable protein is affected by heat in much the same way as other protein. When any of the dry vegetables high in protein are served at a meal, meat should be eliminated, or the result will be an oversupply of protein. As this condition is not only harmful but wasteful, it is one that should receive proper consideration from the housewife. 13. FAT IN VEGETABLES.--As vegetables as a class are low in protein, so are they low in fat. In the case of some vegetables, the quantity of fat they contain is so small that it is never considered in discussing the food value of these vegetables, while in others slightly larger quantities are to be found. However, on the whole, vegetables are so nearly lacking in this food substance that it is necessary to supply fat in their preparation and in the serving of meals in which they are included. This is done in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of the vegetable. For instance, in order that baked beans may take the place of meat entirely, fat in the form of salt pork is usually added when they are prepared. The pork, of course, also supplies a very small amount of protein, but it is not used with the beans for this purpose. Practically all cooked vegetables are served with butter or with a sauce that contains fat. Green vegetables that require no cooking but are served as a salad, are supplied with fat by the salad dressing that is used with them. The fat varies greatly, depending on the kind of dressing used. 14. CARBOHYDRATES IN VEGETABLES.--When the composition of vegetables is considered chemically, the most striking thing about them is the carbohydrates they contain. It is this that distinguishes this class of foods from animal foods. The carbohydrate of vegetables is found in both its forms, starch and sugar. It is in the form of sugar in many of the vegetables when they are young or immature, but it turns into starch as they mature. This change can be easily observed in the case of peas. As is well known, young green peas are rather sweet because of the sugar they contain, while mature or dried peas have lost their sweetness and are starchy. The sugar that is found in large quantities in such vegetables as peas, carrots, turnips, etc. is largely cane sugar. The starch that vegetables contain occurs in tiny granules, just as it is found in cereals, and is affected by cooking in the same way. The mature vegetables in which the starch has developed, although less tender and less sweet than young ones, have a higher food value. In fact, the carbohydrate that vegetables contain constitutes a large proportion of their food value. One of the chief sources of starch among vegetables is the potato, in which the starch grains are large and, if properly cooked, easily digested. Irish, or white, potatoes contain very little carbohydrate in the form of sugar, but in the sweet potato much of the carbohydrate is sugar. In either of these two forms--starch and sugar--vegetable carbohydrate is easily digested. 15. MINERAL MATTER, OR ASH, IN VEGETABLES.--The mineral matter in vegetables is found in comparatively large quantities, the average amount being slightly over 1 per cent. The presence of this substance is of great value, because the mineral salts of both fruits and vegetables are essential in the diet of adults in order to keep their health in a normal condition. The mineral salts of vegetables render the blood more alkaline instead of more acid, as do those contained in cereals and meat. A large number of vegetables, particularly those low in food value, such as greens, celery, etc., are very valuable for their mineral salts. In reality, this substance and the cellulose they contain are the things that recommend the use of these vegetables in the diet. Minerals of all kinds are found in solution in the water contained in vegetables, but chief among them are calcium, sodium, iron, phosphorus, and sulphur. Greens and salad vegetables are particularly high in iron, the element that assists in keeping the blood in good condition. These minerals are easily lost if the method of cookery is not planned to retain them. 16. CELLULOSE IN VEGETABLES.--The special use of cellulose, as has already been learned, is to serve as bulk in the food containing it. In vegetables, the cellulose varies greatly as to quantity, as well as to texture and the amount that can be digested. In young vegetables, it is very soft and perhaps digestible to a certain extent, but as they grow older it hardens and they become tough. This fact is clearly demonstrated in the case of beets. Those which are pulled from the garden in the summer and cooked are tender and soft, but those which are allowed to mature in the ground and are then put away for winter are, when cooked in the late winter or early spring, so hard and tough that it is almost impossible to make them soft. The quantity of cellulose that vegetables contain therefore depends largely on their age and condition. Those low in total food value contain, as a rule, larger quantities of it than those high in food value. This is due to the fact that both water and cellulose, which are usually found together in large quantities, help to detract from the fuel, or food, value of foods. Very young persons or those who are ill sometimes find it impossible to take in its original form a vegetable that contains a large amount of bulk, or cellulose. In such a case, the vegetable may be put through a colander or a sieve in order to break up the cellulose and make it easier to digest. Under ordinary conditions, cellulose should not be avoided, but should be included in large quantities in the diet through the vegetables that are consumed daily. 17. WATER IN VEGETABLES.--The majority of vegetables contain a large quantity of water. Such vegetables as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc., which are low in total food value, contain the most water, the average percentage being about 95. The dry vegetables, which are high in food value, average only about 10 per cent. of water. The water that is found in vegetables, whether it is much or little, is contained in cell-like structures surrounded by cellulose, and it holds in solution the mineral salts and much of the nutriment of the vegetables. In addition, the water holds in solution to a certain extent the material that gives vegetables their distinctive flavor. When any of this water is lost in the preparation of vegetables, the substances that it contains are also lost. It is therefore essential that correct methods of preparation be chosen for the cooking of this food, so as to prevent the waste of valuable food materials. 18. DIGESTIBILITY OF VEGETABLES.--The digestibility of vegetables is largely an individual matter; that is, a vegetable that agrees with one person may not agree with another. The fact that there appears to be no apparent reason for such a condition would lead to the conclusion that it is due to the peculiarities of the person. Because of this, it is not fair to make the general statement that a particular vegetable is easy to digest and another one is hard to digest. The chief cause for difficulty in the digestion of vegetables lies in their volatile oils, which give them their flavor, but which are irritating to many persons. Vegetables having a strong flavor, such as radishes, onions, cucumbers, cabbage, and cauliflower, are the ones that disagree most frequently with persons who eat them; but sometimes the way in which some of them are cooked has more to do with this than the vegetables themselves. Vegetables containing considerable cellulose and water do not of themselves give trouble in digestion, because they contain practically nothing to digest; but they are sometimes responsible for interfering with the digestion of other foods. Vegetables that are extremely high in starch, such as potatoes, are easily digested by most persons, provided they are properly cooked. For instance, a plain baked potato is easily digested, but the same potato saut\\u00e9d in fat is more difficult of digestion. 19. TABLE SHOWING COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF VEGETABLES.--As vegetables vary considerably in the amount of the food substances they contain, so do they differ greatly in their food value. This is clearly shown in Table I, which gives the percentage of the food substances of vegetables, as well as the food value per pound, in calories, that these vegetables contain. The figures in this table are taken from Atwater's Table of American Food Materials, and refer to the edible portion of the material. In the case of several vegetables, no figures are given by this authority, but in the table here presented the percentages and the calories for the vegetables most similar are used. For example, the figures for lettuce are used for endive, as the composition and food value of this vegetable are not included and it resembles lettuce very closely. Constant reference should be made to Table I as progress is make with the study of vegetables and their preparation. Noting the difference in the composition of the different vegetables, as well as the variation in their food value, will be not only interesting but instructive. For instance, when the housewife realizes that lettuce and celery furnish only 85 to 90 calories to the pound, while dried beans and peas average more than 1,700 calories to the pound, she will understand better the place that these foods occupy in the dietary.

As in the case of other foods, the purchase of vegetables in the market requires special knowledge and attention in order that the best value may be obtained for the money expended. The housewife who has a limited amount of money to spend for food does not buy wisely when she purchases vegetables out of season or those which must be shipped long distances. On the other hand, it will be found that vegetables bought in season as well as those which are plentiful in the particular locality in which they are sold, especially if they are perishable vegetables, are lowest in price and are in the best condition for food. Therefore, whether the income is limited or not, it is wisdom on the part of the housewife to buy vegetables that grow in the neighboring region and to purchase them when they are in season. 21. A very important point for the housewife to keep in mind regarding the purchase of vegetables is that their price is determined not by their value as food, but by their scarcity and the demand for them. Take, for example, the case of mushrooms. As shown in Table I, this vegetable is low in food value, containing only 210 calories to the pound, but, if purchased, they are always an expensive food. The high price asked for mushrooms is entirely dependent on their scarcity. If there is much demand in a certain community for a food that is not plentiful in the market, the price of that food always goes up. As in the case of mushrooms, many expensive foods add practically nothing in the way of nourishment, their only value being in the variety of flavor they supply. 22. Furthermore, in order to provide wisely, the person who purchases vegetables for the family should be able to judge whether she is getting full value in food for the money she invests. She cannot always do this with each particular vegetable purchased, but she can buy in such a way that what she purchases will average correctly in this respect. The perishable vegetables should be bought as fresh as possible. No difficulty will be experienced in determining this, for they will soon wither or rot if they are not fresh, but the point is to find out their condition before they are bought. The housewife should be ever on the alert and should examine carefully the vegetables she buys before they are accepted from the grocer or taken from the market. In the case of certain vegetables, it is possible to conceal the fact that they are stale. For instance, the outside leaves of a head of lettuce or endive are sometimes removed and only the bleached center is offered for sale; but this always indicates that the outside leaves were either withered or spoiled or they would not have been taken off. 23. Much of the spoiling of vegetables can be avoided if proper attention is given to them in the market. Food of this kind should be so displayed that it is not exposed to the dirt and dust of the street, nor to flies and other destructive vermin. The practice of displaying vegetables on a stand in front of a store is gradually losing favor with the housewife who understands the sanitary precautions that should be taken with foods. On the other hand, housewives owe it to the merchant not to handle the foods they are going to buy, for the handling of them not only injures them so that they will not keep well, but renders them unfit to be accepted by the next purchaser. 24. The manner in which vegetables are sold should also receive consideration. It has been the custom to sell them by measure, but both housewives and merchants have come to realize that it is fairer to sell them by weight. Experience has shown that a pound is much more likely to be always uniform than is a quart or a peck. This is due to the fact that no two dealers are likely to measure in exactly the same way, even though the measures they use are up to the standard in size. Then, too, especially in the case of vegetables that are of various sizes and shapes, it is impossible to fill a measure properly because of the shape of the vegetables, and so either the housewife often receives short measure or the merchant gives more than the measure requires. All difficulty of this kind is entirely overcome when vegetables are weighed. CARE OF VEGETABLES 25. PERISHABLE VEGETABLES, that is, those which spoil quickly, are usually bought in small quantities, and so are used up quickly. However, if they are kept on hand for only a day or so, they require a definite amount of care in order to insure the most satisfactory results in their use. To prevent them from spoiling or withering, they should be kept in a cool, damp place until they are needed. The most effective and convenient way in which to accomplish this is to store them in a refrigerator or other similar device. If ice cannot be obtained, the cellar should be utilized. Before vegetables of this kind are put away after being delivered from the market, they should be looked over carefully, and any that are spoiled should be discarded in order to prevent others that they might touch from becoming tainted. As little handling as possible, however, is advantageous, because when such foods become bruised and are then allowed to stand they are likely to spoil very quickly. 26. The less perishable vegetables, commonly called WINTER VEGETABLES because they may be kept through the winter, may be bought in quantity, provided proper storage facilities to prevent them from spoiling are available. Potatoes, in particular, are usually purchased in this way, for, as a rule, they may be obtained at a better price than when bought in small quantities, and then, too, they are a vegetable that most families use nearly every day. If they are bought in quantity, they should first be thoroughly tested, for often a potato looks very well on the outside while its texture and flavor may not be at all in accordance with its appearance. Great care should also be exercised to see that this vegetable, as well as carrots, turnips, parsnips, etc., has not been frosted, for frost ruins them as to texture and keeping qualities. All such vegetables as these, provided they must be stored for any length of time, keep best in a cold, fairly dry atmosphere. To prevent them from sprouting, the storage room should, if possible, be kept dark, but in case they do sprout, the sprouts should be removed as soon as they are discovered. The best receptacles for the storage of these winter vegetables are bins, a convenient type of which is shown in _Essentials of Cookery_, Part 2, and the most satisfactory place in which to put such bins is a cellar that has a dirt floor rather than a board or a cement floor. CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES 27. Because of their difference in physical structure, both as plants or parts of plants, and their variation in chemical composition, it is a rather difficult matter to classify vegetables. The vegetables that are discussed throughout these Sections are therefore not included in any classes, but are arranged alphabetically, a plan that the housewife will find very convenient. However, there are a few general classes whose names and characteristics should be known by the housewife, for an understanding of them will enable her to make a more intelligent use of this food. These classes, together with a brief description of the features that characterize them and the names by which the principal varieties are known, are here given. [Illustration: FIG. 1] 28. SUCCULENT VEGETABLES are those which are generally eaten for their appetizing effect and their value as a source of mineral salts and bulk. These vegetables, which get their name from the fact that they are juicy in texture, include the greens, such as spinach, Swiss chard, dandelion, lettuce, etc., also celery, asparagus, cabbage, and all other plants whose green leaves and stems are edible. Succulent vegetables may be cooked, but they are often used as cold relishes or in the making of salads. 29. ROOT, TUBER, and BULB VEGETABLES form another class. Examples of several well-known roots are shown in Fig. 1, which from left to right are salsify, carrots, turnips, and parsnips. The varieties included in this class are closely related as to food value, and on the whole average much higher in this characteristic than do the succulent vegetables. Irish potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes are examples of tubers; sweet potatoes, beets, radishes, etc., in addition to the vegetables shown in Fig. 1, belong to the roots; and onions and all the vegetables related to the onion, such as garlic, shallots, and leeks, are illustrations of bulbs or enlarged underground stems. 30. FRUIT and FLOWER VEGETABLES form a third class. They present great variety in appearance, structure, and composition. To this class belong cucumbers, eggplant, winter and summer squash, vegetable marrow, tomatoes, peppers, and okra, which are in reality fruits but are used as vegetables. Flower vegetables include California, or French, artichokes, and cauliflower, all of which are in reality the buds of flowers or plants and are eaten for food. 31. LEGUMES form a fourth class of vegetables, and they include all the varieties of beans, peas, and lentils. When these foods are mature and dried, they have the highest food value of all the vegetables. Among the beans are Lima beans, kidney beans, navy, or soup, beans, soy beans, and many others. The peas include the various garden varieties that have been allowed to mature, cow-peas, and many others, some of which are not suitable for human consumption. The lentils occur in numerous varieties, too, but those commonly used are the red, yellow, and black ones. To legumes also belong peanuts, but as they are seldom used as vegetables in cookery, no further mention is made of them in this Section. * * * * * VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES AND THEIR PREPARATION GENERAL METHODS OF PREPARATION AND COOKING 32. PREPARING VEGETABLES FOR COOKING.--Before many vegetables can be cooked, they require a certain amount of preparation, such as washing, soaking, peeling, cutting up into suitable sizes, etc. When they must be peeled, great care should be taken not to remove too much of the vegetable with the skin. Whenever it is possible to do so, vegetables should be cooked in their skins, as there is much less waste of edible material if the skins are removed after cooking. Potatoes that are to be fried, hashed brown, or used for salad and other similar dishes may be boiled in their skins and peeled afterwards just as conveniently as to be peeled first and then boiled. Indeed, this plan is strongly recommended, for it not only saves material that is removed in the peeling but also conserves the mineral salts and the soluble food material, much of which is lost in the water during the cooking. 33. If it is desired to remove the peeling before cooking, it will be found more economical to put the vegetables in water and then scrape off the skins than to cut them off with a knife. This method is especially satisfactory with new potatoes and with such vegetables as carrots, parsnips, salsify, and turnips. The scraping can be accomplished more easily if the vegetables are first plunged into boiling water for a few minutes and then dipped into cold water. When entire heads of such vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, etc. are to be cooked, they should be soaked, head down, for at least 1/2 hour in salted water made by adding 1 teaspoon-full of salt to 1 quart of water. This is done in order to remove any bugs or worms that may be lodged in the head. The correct proportion of salt is an important detail of this process, for if salt water that is too strong is used, it will kill the bugs or worms and they will remain in the head. 34. METHODS OF COOKING APPLIED TO VEGETABLES.--The usual methods of cooking applied to vegetables are boiling, steaming, baking, stewing, frying, saut\\u00e9ing, broiling, and roasting. Which one of these to select depends, of course, on the particular kind of vegetable that is to be cooked and the result that is desired, but, if possible, an effort should be made to select an economical method. Starchy vegetables, such as Irish and sweet potatoes, beans, etc., develop a more delicious flavor when they are baked than when they are cooked by any other method of preparation. Steaming is an excellent means of preparing vegetables that must be cooked by moist heat, especially when it is desired that no soluble material be lost, as is often the case in boiling. Frying and saut\\u00e9ing, when applied to vegetables, usually produce a delicious flavor, but often render the vegetables decidedly indigestible. For this reason, vegetables so prepared should seldom if ever be served to children and to persons whose digestion is not good. 35. EFFECT OF COOKING ON VEGETABLES.--The various ways in which cooking affects vegetables should be thoroughly understood by the housewife. In the first place, some methods conserve the food material whereas others waste it. For instance, boiling in water, which is probably one of the most common ways of cooking vegetables, is decidedly advantageous in some respects, but the water dissolves much of the soluble material, such as mineral salts, sugar, etc., found in the vegetables, so that unless some use is made of this water in the cooking of other foods, considerable waste results. On the other hand, steaming and baking permit no loss of food material, and so they should be applied to vegetables whenever it is desired to conserve food substances. 36. The flavors of vegetables are greatly changed during the process of cooking, being increased in some cases and decreased in others. In the case of such strongly flavored vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower, onions, etc., it is advisable to dissipate part of the flavor. Therefore such vegetables should be cooked in an open vessel in order that the flavor may be decreased by evaporation. Vegetables mild in flavor, however, are improved by being cooked in a closed vessel, for all their flavor should be retained. The overcooking of vegetables is sometimes responsible for an increase of a disagreeable flavor. 37. Another feature of vegetables often changed by cooking is their color. For instance, green vegetables do not, upon cooking, always remain green. In many cases, the color may be improved by adding a very small quantity of soda to the water in which the vegetables are cooked. Attention should also be given to the length of time vegetables are subjected to heat, for the overboiling of some vegetables is liable to develop an unattractive color in them. This is particularly the case with cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, which develop not only a strong, disagreeable flavor but also a reddish color when cooked too long. 38. The application of heat to vegetables also has a definite effect on them. By sufficient cooking, the cellulose of vegetables is softened to the extent that it is less irritating and much more likely to be partly digested than that of raw vegetables. The acids of fruits increase upon cooking, and so the acidity of vegetables is increased to a certain extent. Vegetables that contain starch are rendered digestible in no other way than by cooking. On the other hand, the protein material of this food is coagulated by the application of heat, just as the white of an egg or the tissue of meat is coagulated and hardened. However, cooking is the only means of softening the cellulose that surrounds this material. Still, high-protein foods, such as beans, peas, and lentils, can be much improved if they are cooked in water that is not very hard. The lime in hard water has a tendency to harden them to the extent that they require a much longer time to cook than when soft water is used. These vegetables may be still further softened by the addition of a small quantity of soda to the water in which they are cooked, but care should be taken not to use too much soda, as it will injure the flavor. When soda is used, the vegetable should be parboiled for 10 or 15 minutes in the soda water and then drained and cooked in fresh water. This method, of course, does not apply to vegetables that are cooked in soda water to retain their color. 39. Salt is always added in the cooking of vegetables to season them. In the use of salt, two important points must be borne in mind: first, that it has the effect of hardening the tissues of the vegetable in much the same manner as it hardens the tissues of meat; and, secondly, that it helps to draw out the flavor of the vegetables. These two facts determine largely the time for adding the salt. If an old, tough, winter vegetable is to be prepared, it should be cooked until nearly soft in water that contains no salt, and the salt should be added just before the cooking is finished. When it is desired to draw out the flavor, as, for instance, when vegetables are cooked for soup or stews, the salt should be supplied when the vegetables are put on to cook. Young tender vegetables may be cooked in salt water, but as such water extracts a certain amount of flavor, an effort should be made to use it in the preparation of stews, sauces, and soups. SAUCES FOR VEGETABLES 40. Vegetables may, of course, be served plain, but they are greatly improved in flavor, nutritive value, and often in appearance by the addition of a well-seasoned sauce. Numerous sauces are used for this purpose, the one to select depending somewhat on the vegetable, the method of cooking employed, and the flavor that is desired. Recipes for the sauces found to be most satisfactory are here given. It will be well to practice the making of these, so as to become familiar with them and thus know just what sauce is meant when reference is made to a particular sauce in the recipes for vegetables. The quantities given in the recipes for sauces will make sufficient sauce to dress the vegetables required for four to six persons. White sauce, which is probably the one that is used oftenest, may be made in various thicknesses, as has been explained previously. However, the medium white sauce has been found to be the one most nearly correct for vegetables and consequently the one most preferred. MEDIUM WHITE SAUCE 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. milk Melt the butter and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Pour into this the milk, which has been previously heated, and cook together until the flour thickens completely. Pour over the vegetable, from which the water has been previously drained, and serve. VEGETABLE SAUCE 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1/2 c. milk 1/2 c. water in which vegetable was cooked Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, and pepper, and pour into this the heated liquids. Cook until the mixture thickens. Pour over the drained vegetable and serve hot. DRAWN-BUTTER SAUCE 1/4 c. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. hot water Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, and pepper, and pour into this the hot water. Boil for a few minutes and serve. HOLLANDAISE SAUCE 1/3 c. butter 1 Tb. flour 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 c. boiling water 1 egg yolk 2 Tb. vinegar or lemon juice Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, and water, and cook until the mixture thickens. While still hot, pour over the slightly beaten egg yolk, beating constantly to prevent curding. Add the vinegar or lemon juice. Serve with vegetables that have been boiled in salt water. SOUR-CREAM DRESSING 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 3/4 c. milk or sweet cream 1/4 c. vinegar Melt the butter and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Pour into this the heated milk or cream, and allow the sauce to thicken. Then add the vinegar, stirring rapidly, and serve hot. TOMATO SAUCE 1-1/2 c. stewed tomatoes 1 slice onion 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Heat the tomatoes with the onion and force through a sieve. Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, pepper, and the strained tomatoes. Cook together until thick, remove, and serve hot with a vegetable. MA\\u00ceTRE D'H\\u00d4TEL SAUCE 1/3 c. butter 1 Tb. chopped parsley 2 Tb. lemon juice 1/4 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Melt the butter and add the chopped parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well, and allow the whole to boil, but not to brown. Pour over the vegetable and serve. PARSLEY-BUTTER SAUCE 1/2 c. butter 1 Tb. chopped parsley 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Heat the butter in a saucepan until it is well browned, and then add the parsley, salt, and pepper. Allow the sauce to become hot, but not to boil. This is an excellent sauce to use over new potatoes or diced vegetables, such as turnips or carrots. ASPARAGUS AND ITS PREPARATION 41. ASPARAGUS is a vegetable that consists of the shoots of the plant, which are eaten before the blossoms develop. It grows quickly and is very tender if the shoots are clipped at just the right time after they appear above the ground. It comes early in the spring, being about the first green vegetable that gets into the local market, but its season is comparatively short. It does not keep long after it is purchased and is better when it is used at once. If asparagus must be kept for any length of time, it should be stored in a cool, damp place. 42. In selecting asparagus, it should be remembered that there are two varieties, one of which is green and the other white. The stems of the green asparagus should be green to the bottom, and should not be hard nor woody where they are cut from the plant. However, if a part of the stems is found to be woody, the hard ends should not be rejected, for the outside may be peeled off and the center used, or the hard ends may be cooked with other vegetables for the making of soup. The white asparagus will have slightly green tips, while the rest of the stem will be white. Asparagus is one of the succulent vegetables comparatively low in food value. It contains, as Table I shows, only one-fourth as many calories to the pound as potatoes. Its food value, however, may be increased by dressing it with butter after the vegetable has been cooked or by serving with it a sauce made with milk, butter, flour, etc. Then, too, asparagus is sometimes served on toast, which is another means of making a more nutritious dish out of this vegetable. In its composition, asparagus contains a _diuretic_, that is, a substance that has an effect upon the kidneys, and that is known as _asparagine_. Because of the presence of this substance, asparagus is thought to be injurious to those who have kidney trouble, but it need not be avoided except in some forms of this disease. 43. PREPARATION FOR COOKING.--To prepare asparagus for cooking, strip the tiny scales from the sides of the stems by means of a small paring knife. These hold sand and are responsible for the presence of the grit that is sometimes found in a cooked dish of asparagus even when the housewife feels certain that she has washed it as clean as possible. Then wash the stems thoroughly in several cold waters, lifting them out of the water after each washing instead of pouring the water off of them. If the water is poured off the stems, the sand that has been washed from them is likely to remain in the bottom of the pan and mix with the vegetable again. When the asparagus has been sufficiently washed, it may be used in the full lengths or cut into pieces of any desired length, 1 inch being the size that is usually preferred. If stems are to be cooked whole, it is a good plan to form them into a bunch as when purchased and tie the bunch with a tape or a string. When this is done, the string should, of course, be cut and removed before the asparagus is served. A point to remember about the preparation of this vegetable is that it should always be cooked in boiling, salted water. 44. ASPARAGUS WITH BUTTER DRESSING.--Perhaps the simplest way in which to prepare asparagus is to cook it in salted water and then serve it with a butter dressing. When prepared in this way, it may be served plain, but it becomes more attractive, as well as more nutritious, if it is placed on squares of toast. For this dish, secure a bunch of fresh, tender asparagus, wash it thoroughly, and then, as desired, cut it into inch lengths or allow it to remain whole. Pour enough boiling water over it to cover well, add salt in the proportion of 1 teaspoonful to each quart of water, and allow it to cook until the stems may be easily pierced with a fork, which in most cases will require not more than from 10 to 15 minutes. The length of the cooking is an important factor with this vegetable, for when it is overcooked its flavor is not so agreeable as when it has had just enough cooking. When the asparagus is done, drain off the water, season with a little more salt and a dash of pepper, and, if it is to be served without toast, add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each bunch cooked, allowing the butter to melt. In case it is to be served on toast, allow a small amount of the liquid in which it was cooked to remain on it, add the butter to this, and, after placing several of the stems or a number of the pieces on the squares of toast, dip a little of the liquid over all. 45. CREAMED ASPARAGUS ON TOAST.--A still more nutritious dish can be prepared from asparagus by combining it with a cream sauce and serving it on toast. The sauce supplies protein and fat and the toast furnishes carbohydrate, substances in which this vegetable is low. Numerous ways of serving this combination may be resorted to, but one of the most attractive methods is illustrated in Fig. 2. As here shown, a small bunch of the stems is slipped through a ring of toast cut by means of round cutters of two sizes. If it is not desired to use toast for this, a ring of lemon rind or pimiento may be substituted, or the ring may be omitted altogether and the stems merely laid in an orderly manner on a square of toast. Also, with this dish, as with the previous one, the asparagus may be cut into inch lengths instead of being cooked whole. [Illustration: FIG. 2] To prepare creamed asparagus, clean it in the manner explained in Art. 43. Then either cut it into inch lengths or allow the stems to remain whole, and cook it in enough boiling salted water to cover it well. While the asparagus is cooking, prepare a medium white sauce. As soon as the asparagus has cooked enough to be pierced with a fork, pour off the water and serve with the sauce in any of the ways already suggested. If the asparagus is left whole, the sauce is poured over it after it is placed on the toast, but when it is cut into small pieces, it is usually combined with the sauce and the creamed vegetable then poured over the toast. 46. SCALLOPED ASPARAGUS.--Another nutritious dish with asparagus as its base is scalloped asparagus. This involves all the ingredients used in creamed asparagus, but to give it still more food value, cheese is also added. SCALLOPED ASPARAGUS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 bunch asparagus 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 c. asparagus stock 1/2 c. milk 1/4 tsp. salt 1 c. buttered cracker crumbs 1/2 c. grated cheese Clean the asparagus according to the directions given in Art. 43. Cut it into inch lengths and cook in boiling salted water until it is tender enough to be pierced with a fork, and then drain. Prepare a sauce by melting the butter, adding the flour, and pouring into this mixture the heated stock and milk seasoned with the salt. Put a layer of the buttered crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish, and pour half the asparagus over them. Sprinkle the asparagus with one-third the cheese and add another layer of crumbs. Sprinkle this with one-third the cheese. Add the remainder of the asparagus and the crumbs and sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top. Pour the sauce over the entire mixture, place in the oven, and bake until heated thoroughly and the top is slightly browned. Serve from the baking dish. * * * * * BEANS AND THEIR PREPARATION VARIETIES OF BEANS 47. Of all the vegetables commonly used for food, BEANS afford the greatest variety. However, there are two principal classes into which all varieties of this vegetable can be placed, namely, _string beans_ and _shell beans_. String beans include both the pods and the seeds, and are used when the beans are very young. Shell beans consist of the seeds, which are allowed to mature either partly or entirely and are taken from the shells before cooking. Those which are partly developed are cooked when they are fresh, but the ones that are allowed to mature completely are dried and then stored for use at any time during the year. In some cases, the same variety of beans may be used in the three ways mentioned, while in others certain kinds are raised expressly for one of these purposes. 48. The food value of beans increases as they mature, as will be observed upon reference to Table I. The very young beans, that is, the string beans, which include the pods and all, are comparatively low in food value, being only a little higher than asparagus. To increase the food value of these, fat meat, butter, or other fat is supplied in their cooking, or milk or a cream sauce is added before they are served. Fresh shell beans have much more nutriment than string beans, whereas dried beans are very high in food value. It is this characteristic of dried shell beans that makes them a very good meat substitute. STRING BEANS 49. VARIETIES OF STRING BEANS.--There are two general varieties of string beans: the yellow ones, which are commonly known as _wax beans_, and the green ones, which are the ones usually meant when the term string beans is used. Numerous varieties exist among these classes, and some are very much better than others. Many of them have strings, but others are stringless and consequently are easier to prepare. Whatever kind is used should be picked from the vines before the beans are old enough for the pods to develop woody fibers. Otherwise they will not be palatable, for when they have reached this stage it will be impossible to cook them soft. 50. SELECTION AND CARE.--Small, round, rusty-looking spots are common to both string and wax beans; but when such spots are present they must be removed before cooking. As there is considerable waste in the preparation of such beans for the table, it is wise in buying string beans to select those whose surface is not marred with such blemishes. In addition, the beans should be as fresh as can be obtained and crisp and tender enough to snap when the pods are bent in half. Proper attention should be given to them after they are purchased, too. If possible, they should be cooked immediately, but if this cannot be done they should be kept in a cool, damp place to prevent them from becoming limp. However, if they wilt before they can be cooked, they may be freshened by allowing them to stand in cold water for a short time. 51. PREPARATION AND COOKING.--To prepare beans for cooking, wash them thoroughly in cold water. If the beans are of the stringless variety, cut off the stem and blossom ends; but, in case they have strings, break the ends and strip off the strings together with the ends, as shown in Fig. 3. The beans may then be cooked whole or cut into inch lengths before cooking. If it is desired to cut them, the most convenient way is to place them in an orderly heap on a cutting board and then cut a handful at a time, drawing a sharp knife across them as they are held on the board. Any imperfect portions should be removed before cutting. 52. The cooking of string beans is similar to that of asparagus, except that they require longer cooking. Put them, either whole or cut into a kettle, cover them with boiling water to which has been added 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water, and cook them with the cover on the kettle until they can be easily pierced with a fork. The length of time required to cook them depends on the age of the beans, but usually from 30 minutes to 1 hour will be sufficient. When they are done, drain the water from them, but save it to make sauce for them or to add to soup stock. 53. STRING BEANS IN BUTTER.--String beans, which, of course, include wax beans, may be served with a sauce of some kind, but they are very appetizing when merely drained after cooking and served with melted butter. [Illustration: FIG. 3] To prepare beans in this manner, wash the desired amount, remove the ends and strings, if necessary, and cut into inch lengths. Cook until they are tender and then pour off the water. Add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served, a dash of pepper, and, if they are not salty enough, a little more salt. Allow the butter to melt and serve the beans hot. 54. STRING BEANS WITH SALT PORK.--Those who like the flavor of salt pork will find string beans cooked with a small piece of this meat very appetizing. Besides improving the flavor, salt pork supplies the beans with fat, a food substance in which they are very low. After washing the beans that are to be cooked in this way, remove the ends and strings, but do not cut into inch lengths. Put the whole beans to cook in boiling water and add 1/4 pound of pork for a sufficient amount of beans for four persons. Cook until the beans are tender, and serve with the pork without removing from the liquid. 55. CREAMED STRING BEANS.--Perhaps the most popular way in which to prepare string or wax beans is to cream them. Not only an appetizing dish, but one whose food value is increased, is the result. The cream sauce served with the beans may be made entirely of milk, but a very satisfactory sauce can be made by using half milk or cream and half liquid in which the beans were cooked. To prepare creamed beans, clean the beans in the usual way and cut them into inch lengths. Put them to cook in boiling salted water and cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork. Pour off the water, but keep it to use in the dressing. To dress a sufficient quantity of beans for four persons, a sauce should be made as follows: SAUCE FOR CREAMED STRING BEANS 1 Tb. butter 1 Tb. flour 1/4 tsp. salt Pinch of pepper 1/3 c. rich milk or cream 1/3 c. liquid from beans Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Pour in the heated liquids and stir until the mixture is smooth and thoroughly cooked. Add the sauce to the beans, heat together, and serve. 56. STRING BEANS WITH SOUR DRESSING.--A dish having an entirely different flavor from those already explained is produced when beans are served with a sour dressing. To prepare beans in this way, clean a sufficient number according to the directions already given and cut them into inch lengths. Cook them in boiling salted water until they are tender. Pour off the water, but retain 1/2 cupful for the dressing. Make the following sauce, which will dress a sufficient quantity of beans for four persons: SOUR DRESSING 2 Tb. ham or bacon fat 1 Tb. flour 1/4 c. vinegar 1/2 c. liquid from beans Melt the fat in a double boiler, add the flour, and into this stir the vinegar and the liquid from the beans. Cook until the mixture thickens and pour over the beans. Reheat and serve. SHELL BEANS 57. VARIETIES AND FOOD VALUE OF SHELL BEANS.--When beans have matured on the vines to such an extent that the pods are no longer tender enough for human consumption, they are picked and the seeds then used for food. Some are picked before the seeds have entirely matured, and these, which must be young enough to contain considerable moisture, are cooked fresh; others are allowed to mature entirely and are then dried before they are cooked. After being dried, beans keep indefinitely and require no care in storage except that they must not become moist. Numerous varieties of both fresh and dried shell beans are in use, including navy, marrowfat, pinto, and Lima beans. 58. Fresh shell beans average about three times as much food value as string or wax beans. Most of this is carbohydrate in the form of starch, but they also contain considerable protein. Dried shell beans, which are entirely different in flavor and texture from fresh ones, contain still more nutriment, their food value being more than twice that of fresh shell beans and over four times that of potatoes. In the entirely matured bean, which, as has already been mentioned, belongs to the class of vegetables called legumes, the high food value is due to the high percentage of starch and the large amount of protein in the form of legumin, a substance that is an important substitute for other more expensive protein foods. This composition reveals at once the fact that dried shell beans make an excellent food, provided some fat is added to them in their preparation. 59. PREPARATION AND COOKING OF FRESH SHELL BEANS.--With the exception of Lima beans, most of the varieties of fresh shell beans are placed on the market in the pods and must be shelled after they are purchased. Green Lima beans, however, are usually sold shelled. If the beans are purchased in the pods, wash them in cold water before shelling, but if they are bought shelled, wash the shelled beans. Then put them to cook in sufficient boiling water to which has been added 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart. Allow the beans to cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork. The cooking will probably require from 45 minutes to 1-1/2 hours, depending on the age and variety of the beans. 60. SHELL BEANS DRESSED WITH BUTTER.--Any variety of fresh shell beans may be prepared according to the accompanying recipe, but Lima beans are especially delicious when cooked in this way. Prepare and cook the beans as directed in Art. 59. When they are sufficiently cooked, pour off the water, season with additional salt, if necessary, and a dash of pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt and serve the beans hot. 61. SHELL BEANS IN CREAM.--Fresh shell beans are especially appetizing when they are dressed with cream. Besides improving the flavor, cream also adds considerable food value, an item that should not be overlooked. For this dish, prepare and cook the beans in the manner explained in Art. 59. When they are tender, pour off the water and season with additional salt and pepper. Then for each four persons to be served, add 1 tablespoonful of butter and 1/2 cupful of thin cream. Heat the beans well in the cream and serve. 62. BEAN PUR\\u00c9E.--Persons with whom the coarse skins that must necessarily be eaten with beans disagree, find bean pur\\u00e9e very satisfactory. To prepare it, clean and cook the beans in boiling salted water according to the directions given in Art. 59. Then pour off the water and force the beans through a ricer or a sieve. Add sufficient butter, salt, and pepper to season well and serve hot. 63. COOKING OF DRIED SHELL BEANS.--Before dried shell beans of any variety are cooked, look them over very carefully, reject any that are unfit for use, and wash the rest in cold water. They may then be cooked without further preparation, but in order to hasten their cooking and save fuel in their preparation, it is a good plan to moisten them by soaking them in water before cooking. If they are to be soaked, place them in cold water and allow them to remain there for 8 to 12 hours. Then put them on to cook in water to which has been added a small pinch of soda. Parboil the beans in this water until the outside skin begins to crack and then pour off the water. While it is true that a certain amount of mineral salts and perhaps a small percentage of food value are lost in this procedure, because the water that is poured off is too strong to be used for any other purpose, the improvement in the flavor warrants any loss that might occur. After pouring off the water, wash the beans in cold water, add fresh water to continue the cooking, and allow the beans to simmer slowly until they are cooked soft enough to crush between the fingers, but still retain their original shape. Nothing is gained by cooking them rapidly on a hot fire, and considerable fuel is wasted by this practice. The fireless cooker and the double boiler are excellent utensils for the cooking of dried beans, because they cook the beans at a temperature below boiling point. They therefore cook the beans soft with little difficulty and prevent the protein from becoming hard. The theory of the cooking of protein--that is, the higher the temperature, the harder the coagulation--applies in the cooking of dried beans, just as it does in the cooking of eggs or milk. 64. STEWED NAVY BEANS.--The common small white beans are called _navy beans_ from the fact that they are much used in the navy. These may be prepared in various ways, but the simplest method is to stew them. In the preparation of this dish, as well as any other made from dried beans, it will be well to remember that 1/2 cupful of beans is usually sufficient to serve four persons when they are cooked. Look over the required amount of beans, reject any that are imperfect, wash thoroughly, and put to soak overnight in cold water. Pour off any water that remains, cover well with boiling water, and add a pinch of soda. Cook slowly until the skins begin to burst. Pour off the water, add fresh hot water and 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water, and allow to simmer until the beans may be easily crushed between the fingers. During this process, the water should cook down until just a sufficient amount to serve with the beans remains. When this is accomplished, add 1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of butter, a dash of pepper, and, if necessary, additional salt. Instead of the butter, ham or bacon fat may be used for seasoning, or a small piece of ham or salt pork may be cooked with the beans and the fat omitted. Serve the beans hot. 65. LIMA BEANS IN CREAM.--Dried Lima beans, when combined with thin cream, make a very appetizing dish. To prepare them in this way, clean, soak, and cook them as explained in Art. 63. When they are soft enough to crush easily between the fingers and the water has boiled down so that practically none remains, add 1/2 cupful of thin cream to a sufficient quantity for four persons. Allow the beans to simmer for a short time in the cream, add additional salt and a dash of pepper for flavoring, and serve. 66. LIMA BEANS EN CASSEROLE.--While the small varieties of dried beans are more commonly baked than the larger ones, Lima beans will be found especially delicious when prepared in a casserole. LIMA BEANS EN CASSEROLE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. dried Lima beans 1/4 c. ham or bacon fat 2 c. milk 2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper Soak the beans overnight and then parboil them in soda water. Drain off the water and turn the beans into a baking dish. Add the fat, milk, salt, and pepper. Cover the dish and bake until the beans are soft. Serve hot from the casserole. [Illustration: FIG. 4] 67. LIMA-BEAN LOAF.--If a dish that is not only appetizing, but sufficient in food value to be used as a meat substitute, is desired, Lima-bean loaf, which is illustrated in Fig. 4, should be selected. This is very good when served alone, but it becomes more attractive and at the same time more palatable when a sauce or gravy is added. LIMA-BEAN LOAF (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. dried Lima beans 2 c. bread crumbs Milk to moisten crumbs 2 eggs 1 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 tsp. celery salt 2 Tb. butter Soak the beans overnight and parboil them in soda water. Pour off this water, cook until tender in boiling salted water, and then drain. Moisten the bread crumbs slightly with milk, mix them with the beans, and add the beaten eggs and seasoning. When the entire mixture is well blended, place in a loaf pan, dot the top with the butter, and bake in the oven until nicely browned and quite firm. Turn out on a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve by cutting it into slices, as shown in Fig. 4. 68. BEAN SOUFFL\\u00c9.--Probably the daintiest dish that can be made from dried beans is bean souffl\\u00e9. This is equally suitable as the main dish for a luncheon or a home dinner. One point to remember about it is that it should be served immediately, for souffl\\u00e9 usually settles when taken from the oven. BEAN SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. bean pulp 1 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1/4 tsp. celery salt 1 Tb. onion juice 2 eggs Make the bean pulp by forcing well-cooked beans through a colander or a press. Add all the seasoning and the beaten egg yolks. Beat the egg whites stiff and fold them into the mixture. When well blended, pour into a greased baking dish, or individual dishes, place in a pan containing hot water, and bake in a moderate oven until the souffl\\u00e9 is set, which will require from 30 to 45 minutes. Test by tapping slightly with the finger. If the dent thus made in the souffl\\u00e9 springs back, it is sufficiently baked. Remove from the oven and serve at once. [Illustration: FIG. 5] 69. BAKED BEANS.--Almost any kind of dried beans may be used for baking. Some persons prefer the small navy beans, which are mentioned in this recipe, whereas others like the larger marrowfat beans or Lima beans. Pinto beans have for some time been taking the place of navy beans, and are found to be a very good substitute. To bake beans successfully, a dish with a tight-fitting cover, such as the one shown in Fig. 5, is required. This is made of heavy glass, but if such a utensil is not available, very satisfactory results can be obtained by using a heavy earthen bowl, crock, or baking dish. To produce the delicious flavor that is agreeable to most persons, beans should be baked a long time. Therefore, as considerable heat is consumed in their cooking, it is a wise plan to prepare more than enough for one meal. They may be served the second time as baked beans, or, if this is not desired, they may be used for various other purposes. BAKED BEANS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 pt. navy beans 2 Tb. molasses 2 tsp. salt 1/2 lb. bacon or salt pork Soak the beans overnight, parboil in soda water, and drain. Add a sufficient amount of water to cover the beans well, cook until they break open, and then pour with the liquid into a baking dish. If this liquid does not almost cover the beans, add more until it comes nearly to the top. Add the molasses and salt, cut the salt pork into pieces, and distribute these well through the beans, placing a piece or two over the top. The beans should then appear as shown in Fig. 5. Place the cover on the dish and bake in a slow oven for 4 or 5 hours. Remove the cover occasionally, stir the beans carefully so as not to crush nor break them, and add enough water from time to time to keep the beans well moistened. When done, the beans should be light brown in color, but the top should be well browned. Sometimes it will be found necessary to remove the cover in order to brown the beans sufficiently. 70. BEAN CROQUETTES.--Left-over baked beans need never be wasted, for there are numerous uses to which they can be put. If it is not desired to reheat them and serve them again as baked beans, they may be utilized in soup, salads, and sandwiches, or they may be made into souffl\\u00e9, as explained in Art. 68, or into croquettes according to the accompanying recipe. Bean croquettes may be served plain, but they are much improved by the addition of tomato sauce. BEAN CROQUETTES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. cold baked beans 1-1/2 c. bread crumbs Milk to moisten crumbs 1 egg 1 tsp. salt Pinch of pepper To the beans add the bread crumbs slightly moistened with milk. Stir in the egg, beaten, and the salt and pepper. Blend the entire mixture, form into croquettes, and roll in dry crumbs. Bake in the oven until brown, saut\\u00e9 in shallow fat, or fry in deep fat. Place on a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve plain or with tomato sauce. BEETS AND THEIR PREPARATION 71. BEETS are a root vegetable that comes in two varieties, _red_ and _white_. The red beets are more popular for cooking than the white ones, and of these the ones that retain their dark-red color after cooking are preferable to any other. The root, however, is not the only part of this plant that is eaten, for the tops are also much used for food. When the tops are to be cooked, the plants are usually not allowed to mature to the extent that the root parts can be used; still, early in the summer, when very small beets are to be had with the tops on, both the tops and the beets may be used. At this age, the beets are very tender and do not require long cooking. If the beets are not eaten when they are young, they are allowed to mature in the ground and are then pulled in the fall and stored for a winter vegetable. Like other root vegetables, beets contain very little protein and fat, but in their composition is included a fairly large percentage of carbohydrate in the form of sugar. Their total food value is greater than that of string beans, but is considerably less than that of potatoes. 72. SELECTION AND CARE OF BEETS.--When beets are selected as a summer vegetable with the idea of using both the tops and the roots, the tops should be fresh, that is, not withered nor rotted. When the roots are to be used, either as a summer or a winter vegetable, they should have a smooth skin, should contain no blemishes, and, as nearly as possible, should be uniform in size. Summer beets require about the same care as any other vegetable; that is, they should be kept in a cool, damp place until they are ready to be cooked. If they are at all wilted at that time, they may be freshened by allowing them to stand in a pan of cold water for several hours. Winter beets, however, should be stored in a cool, dark place where they will not freeze. A portion of the cellar that has a dirt floor is a very good place to put the bins containing such vegetables. The woody tissue of beets that are stored increases as the winter advances, so that any beets that remain until spring are rather hard and extremely difficult to cook. In fact, at times it is almost impossible to make them soft enough to serve, but they can be greatly improved by soaking them in cold water for a few hours before cooking them. 73. PREPARATION AND COOKING OF BEETS.--In preparing young beets for cooking, allow an inch or two of the stems to remain on the beets in order to prevent them from bleeding. Of course, from winter beets, the entire stem should be removed, as it will be dried up. Scrub beets of either variety carefully with a vegetable brush until entirely free from dirt. Then, whether they are old or young, put them to cook in boiling water without removing their skins. Allow them to cook until they are soft enough to be pierced with a fork. This is the best way in which to determine when the beets are done, for as the length of time required to cook them depends entirely on their age, no definite time can be stated. As soon as they are sufficiently cooked, pour off the water, allow them to cool enough to handle, and then remove the skins, which will slip off easily. 74. BUTTERED BEETS.--Butter added to beets increases both their nutriment and their flavor. In order to prepare buttered beets, first clean and cook them in the manner just explained. To remove the skins, scrape the beets as thinly as possible, so as not to waste any more than is necessary. Then slice them thin or cut them into 1/2-inch cubes, season well with salt and pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Allow the beets to heat thoroughly in the butter, and serve hot. 75. BEETS WITH CREAM DRESSING.--If a creamed vegetable is desired, beets to which cream has been added will be very satisfactory. Clean and cook the beets in the manner explained in Art. 73. Then peel, cut into slices, place in a saucepan, and nearly cover with thin cream. Allow them to cook in the cream for a few minutes, season with salt and pepper, and serve. 76. BEETS WITH SOUR DRESSING.--To give variety, beets are sometimes served with a sour dressing. Probably no other vegetable lends itself so well to this sort of preparation as beets, with the result that a very appetizing dish is provided. BEETS WITH SOUR DRESSING (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 medium-sized beets 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1/4 c. vinegar 1-1/4 c. hot water Prepare and cook the beets as explained in Art. 73. When tender, drain them, remove the skins, and dice the beets. Make a sauce by melting the butter in a double boiler and adding the flour, salt, pepper, vinegar, and hot water. Cook until the flour thickens the sauce and then pour over the beets. Heat together and serve. 77. BAKED BEETS.--If something entirely different in the way of a vegetable dish is wanted, baked beets will meet with favor. Beets may be baked in a covered baking dish or on the open grate of an oven. A slow fire produces the best results, and as a rule it will take 4 or 5 hours to bake good-sized beets. Wash thoroughly and dry the desired number of beets. Place them in a baking dish and set in a slow oven or place them on the open grate. Bake until they may be pierced with a fork. Remove from the skins and serve with a sour sauce or merely with salt, pepper, and butter. 78. PICKLED BEETS.--When beets are cooked for any of the recipes that have been given, it will be economy to boil more than will be needed for one meal, for a large number can be cooked with practically the same quantity of fuel as a few. Then the remainder may be pickled by peeling them, cutting them into slices, and pouring over them hot vinegar sweetened slightly and flavored with spice. Pickled beets make an excellent relish and they will keep for an indefinite period. BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND THEIR PREPARATION [Illustration: FIG. 6] 79. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, as shown in Fig. 6, look just like tiny green heads of cabbage. These heads grow along a stem that protrudes above the surface of the ground in much the same way as does the stem to which a head of cabbage is attached. The heads are cut from the stem and then usually packed in quart boxes. It is in such boxes as these that they are found in the markets, where they can be purchased from December until early spring. They are considered a great delicacy because of the fineness of their flavor, which rivals that of cauliflower and, while closely resembling that of cabbage, is much superior to it. In food value, they are somewhat higher than cauliflower, but about equal to beets. 80. COOKING OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--To prepare Brussels sprouts for the table, break off the outside leaves from the heads, and then in order to remove any bugs that may be lodged in the heads, allow them to stand in cold salted water for 1 hour or so before cooking. After removing the sprouts from the salted water, pour enough boiling water over them to cover them well, add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water, and boil without any cover on the kettle until they can be easily pierced with a fork. Care should be taken not to overcook the sprouts, for when they are cooked too long they become red in color and develop a strong flavor. [Illustration: FIG. 7] 81. BUTTERED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--When Brussels sprouts are properly cooked and then seasoned with salt and pepper and flavored with butter, an appetizing dish is the result. To make such a dish for about six persons, prepare and cook 1 quart of Brussels sprouts in the manner just explained. When they are tender, pour off the water, season with additional salt and a dash of pepper, and add 2 tablespoonfuls of butter. Allow the butter to melt over the sprouts and then serve hot. If a more attractive dish is desired, the Brussels sprouts prepared in this way may be combined with French lamb chops, as shown in Fig. 7. Pile up the buttered sprouts in the center of a platter, and then place broiled or saut\\u00e9d lamb chops, whose ends are trimmed with paper frills, around the sprouts in the manner shown. 82. CREAMED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--A very satisfactory way in which to prepare Brussels sprouts is to serve a cream sauce over them. This sauce, of course, adds food value, and at the same time greatly improves the flavor of the vegetable. CREAMED BRUSSELS SPROUTS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 qt. Brussels sprouts 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1-1/2 c. milk 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Prepare and cook the sprouts as explained in Art. 80. When they are tender, drain the water from them. Make a white sauce of the butter, flour, milk, salt, and pepper. Pour this over the sprouts, heat together, and serve. 83. SCALLOPED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--Undoubtedly the most palatable way of preparing Brussels sprouts is to scallop them. The ingredients used in the preparation of this dish add food value, as well as flavor. SCALLOPED BRUSSELS SPROUTS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 qt. Brussels sprouts 3 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 tsp. salt 2 c. milk 1 c. buttered crumbs Prepare the sprouts as explained in Art. 80. Cook them in boiling salted water until they are tender, and then drain. Make a white sauce of 2 tablespoonfuls of the butter, flour, salt, and milk. Butter the crumbs by pouring 1 tablespoonful of melted butter over them, stirring until well blended. Place one-fourth of the crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish, add about half of the sprouts, and place another fourth of the crumbs over the sprouts. Add the remaining half of the sprouts and pour the sauce over these. Sprinkle the rest of the crumbs over the top, place in the oven, and bake until the crumbs are brown and the ingredients thoroughly heated. CABBAGE AND ITS PREPARATION 84. CABBAGE consists of the foliage of the cabbage plant. It is a succulent vegetable with a high flavor; in fact, its flavor is so strong that in many cases it disagrees with persons. However, if cabbage is properly cooked, no apprehension need be felt about eating it, for it can be digested by most persons. The food value of cabbage is not high, being even less than that of string beans. The greater part of this food value is carbohydrate in the form of sugar, but in order to prepare cabbage so that it has any importance in the meal, considerable quantities of protein, fat, and carbohydrate must be added. In itself, it is valuable for its mineral salts and bulk. Numerous varieties of cabbage can be procured, but only three are commonly used. These include _white cabbage_, which is used the most; _purple cabbage_, which is very dark in color and contains varying shades of red and blue; and _Savoy cabbage_, which has a large number of green crinkled leaves and is commonly cooked by boiling. 85. SELECTION AND CARE OF CABBAGE.--Heads of cabbage that feel firm and solid to the touch and are rather heavy for their size are the best to select for cooking purposes. This vegetable comes into the market early in the summer and may be had until late in the fall. As it has excellent keeping qualities, it may be stored for use as a winter vegetable. When this is done, the stem and the roots should be allowed to remain on the head, for then the cabbage is less apt to wither. If this precaution is taken and the cabbage is stored in a cool place, no great care is required to keep it in good condition until it is to be cooked unless, of course, it is kept for an abnormal length of time. 86. PREPARATION AND COOKING OF CABBAGE.--To prepare cabbage for cooking, remove the outside leaves and then cut the head that remains into pieces of any desirable size. Whether the cabbage should be left in large pieces or cut very fine depends on the dish that is to be prepared. For the first cutting, be sure to cut the head down through the heart and the stem, so that the part not used will remain intact. This may then be used another time if it is kept cool and moist. In case the cabbage becomes at all wilted, it may be freshened by placing it in cold water a short time before it is to be cooked. 87. Cabbage is a vegetable that has many uses and is eaten both raw and cooked. Numerous opinions exist about the difference in digestibility between raw and cooked cabbage, as well as the best ways in which to cook this vegetable. It may be true that in some cases raw cabbage does not cause the disagreeable effect that cooked cabbage often does, but the reason for this is that cabbage when raw has a milder flavor than when cooked, cabbage generally developing during the cooking a strong flavor that causes trouble. The flavor of cabbage, however, may be dissipated if attention is given to the cooking, so that, when properly prepared, cabbage can be eaten with little fear of indigestion. 88. When cabbage is cooked, it is usually boiled like other vegetables; that is, it is covered well with boiling water to which 1 teaspoonful of salt is added for each quart, and then allowed to boil until it can be easily pierced with a fork. Its cooking differs, however, from that of many vegetables, string beans, for instance, in that it is carried on with the cover removed from the kettle. This plan permits of the evaporation of much of the strong flavor, which arises in the steam and which would otherwise be reabsorbed by the cabbage. Since it is the retention of this flavor, together with long cooking, that causes this vegetable to disagree with persons who eat it, both of these points should be carefully watched. If it is cooked in an open vessel and it is boiled just long enough to be tender, so that when done it is white and fresh-looking and not in any way discolored, an easily digested dish will be the result. Usually cabbage will cook sufficiently in 1/2 hour and often in less time. 89. BOILED CABBAGE.--Although cabbage permits of numerous methods of preparation, plain boiled cabbage finds favor with many persons. Generally, cabbage prepared in this way is merely seasoned with butter and served in a part of the liquid in which it is cooked, but it has a more appetizing flavor if bacon or ham fat is used for seasoning or if a small quantity of ham or salt pork is cooked with it. To prepare boiled cabbage, remove the outside leaves from a head of cabbage, cut it in half down through the heart, and then cut each half into coarse pieces. Unless it is very fresh, allow it to stand in cold water for at least 1 hour before cooking. Put it into a kettle or a saucepan, cover well with boiling water, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. If ham or salt pork is to be cooked with the cabbage, put a small piece in the kettle with the cabbage. Allow the cabbage to cook with the cover removed until it is sufficiently tender to be pierced with a fork. Pour off all or a part of the liquid, depending on whether it is to be served dry or in its own liquid, and then, in case it has been cooked alone, add butter or ham or bacon fat for flavor. If not sufficiently seasoned, add pepper and more salt. 90. CREAMED CABBAGE.--When cabbage is to be creamed, it is cut up into fairly fine pieces with a sharp knife. The cream sauce that is added to it provides considerable food value and greatly improves its flavor. CREAMED CABBAGE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 4 c. finely cut cabbage 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1/2 c. milk or thin cream 1/2 c. liquid from cabbage Cook the cabbage according to the directions given in Art. 89 until it is tender and then drain the water from it. While it is cooking, melt the butter in a double boiler, add the flour, and stir until smooth. Pour in the heated liquid and season with the salt and pepper. Stir until the flour is thickened and the sauce is smooth. Pour this over the cabbage, heat together for a few minutes, and serve hot. 91. SCALLOPED CABBAGE.--Scalloped cabbage is a particularly appetizing vegetable dish, and, on account of the ingredients used in its preparation, it is more nutritious than some of the other dishes in which cabbage is used. SCALLOPED CABBAGE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 4 c. cabbage 1 c. buttered crumbs 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1 c. milk 1/2 c. liquid from cabbage Cut the cabbage into very small pieces with a sharp knife or a cabbage chopper. Cook according to the directions given in Art. 89 until nearly tender, and then drain. Spread 1/4 cupful of the buttered crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish, put one-half of the cabbage over this, and then add another 1/4 cupful of the crumbs and the remaining cabbage. Over this pour a white sauce made from the butter, flour, salt, pepper, milk, and liquid from the cabbage. Sprinkle the rest of the crumbs over the top. Bake in a slow oven until the cabbage is thoroughly heated through and the crumbs are browned on top. This baking will complete the cooking of the cabbage. Serve hot. 92. HOT SLAW.--If a slightly sour flavor is desired in a vegetable dish, hot slaw will undoubtedly appeal to the taste. HOT SLAW (Sufficient to Serve Six) 4 c. cabbage 1 c. water 2 Tb. butter 1 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt 1/3 c. vinegar 1 egg Slice the cabbage very fine with a sharp knife or a cabbage cutter. Put it in a saucepan, add the water, and allow it to cook until the water is about half evaporated. Melt the butter in a pan and to it add the flour, salt, and vinegar. Then stir the beaten egg in quickly and pour this sauce over the cabbage at once. Allow the mixture to cook until the sauce has thickened, stirring constantly to prevent the curding of the egg. Serve hot. 93. MAKING SAUERKRAUT.--As is well known, sauerkraut is a cabbage preparation that is made by salting finely cut cabbage, packing it tightly, and allowing it to ferment under pressure. This food is made and sold commercially, so that the housewife can usually purchase it in any quantity she desires. However, as it is not at all difficult to make sauerkraut, and as a supply of cabbage in this form provides a valuable article of food during the winter months in households where it is relished, the housewife will do well to prepare enough of this kind of cabbage to vary her meals during the winter. That she may understand how to proceed with the making of sauerkraut and the proper cooking of it, the accompanying directions and recipes are given. 94. For every 10 medium-sized heads of cabbage, measure 2 cupfuls of salt. Cut the heads of cabbage into quarters and shred on a cabbage slicer, or cutter. Place several inches of the shredded cabbage in the bottom of a large crock, and over it sprinkle a layer of salt. Stamp this down with a wooden potato masher or some other similar utensil. Then add another layer of cabbage and salt and stamp this down in the same way. Proceed in this manner until the crock is nearly full. Then place a clean cloth over the cabbage in the crock. On this cloth place a clean board as near the size of the crock as possible, and on the board place a large clean stone or some other weight. When thus filled and weighted down, place the crock in a cool place. The cabbage will then begin to ferment, and it is this fermentation that changes the cabbage into sauerkraut. After a time, juice will form and gradually rise over the top of the board, and on top of this juice will form a scum. Remove this scum at once, and do not allow any to collect at any time after the fermentation of the cabbage ceases. Occasionally, when a supply of sauerkraut is taken from the crock for cooking, replace the cloth by a clean one, but always be sure to put the board and the weight back in place. 95. SAUERKRAUT WITH SPARERIBS.--Persons who are fond of sauerkraut find the combination of sauerkraut and spareribs very appetizing. The spareribs give the cabbage a very pleasing flavor and at the same time supply nourishment to the dish. SAUERKRAUT WITH SPARERIBS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 qt. sauerkraut 2 lb. spareribs 1 tsp. salt 3 c. water Put the sauerkraut and the spareribs into a kettle and add the salt and water. Allow to simmer slowly for 2 or more hours. If additional water is necessary, add it from time to time. Just before removing from the heat, allow the water to boil down so that what remains may be served with the hot sauerkraut. 96. BAKED SAUERKRAUT.--In the cooking of sauerkraut for the table, pork in one form or another is generally added; in fact, one rarely thinks of sauerkraut except in combination with pork. While boiling is the method that is usually applied to this vegetable, many housewives prefer to bake it, for then the odor does not escape so easily and a flavor that most persons prefer is developed. BAKED SAUERKRAUT (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 lb. fresh pork 1 qt. sauerkraut 1 Tb. salt 3 c. water Cut the pork into several large chunks, and put it with the sauerkraut into a baking dish that has a cover. Add the salt and water, cover the dish and place in the oven. Bake slowly for 2 or 3 hours. Serve hot. 97. SAUT\\u00c9D SAUERKRAUT.--If an entirely different way of cooking sauerkraut is desired, it may be saut\\u00e9d. When nicely browned and served with boiled frankfurters, it is very appetizing. SAUT\\u00c9D SAUERKRAUT (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 qt. sauerkraut 4 Tb. bacon or ham fat 2 tsp. salt Steam the sauerkraut over boiling water for about 1 hour. Then melt the fat in an iron frying pan, add the sauerkraut and sprinkle with the salt. Place a cover over the pan and allow the sauerkraut to saut\\u00e9 until it is slightly browned on the bottom. Stir and continue to cook until the entire amount is slightly browned. Serve hot. CARROTS AND THEIR PREPARATION 98. CARROTS are one of the root vegetables. They are similar in composition to beets, having practically the same total food value, which is for the most part carbohydrate in the form of sugar. Besides being valuable in the diet for their mineral salts and bulk, they add variety to the menu, especially in the winter, for upon maturing they can be kept for a long time if they are properly stored. As tiny young carrots, they are also much used as a summer vegetable, and when cooked whole and served in an attractive way they make a delicious vegetable dish. 99. SELECTION AND PREPARATION.--The selection of carrots is a simple matter, because they keep well and are not likely to be found in a spoiled condition in the market. When small summer carrots are purchased, they should be fresh and should have their tops on. Winter carrots should be as nearly uniform in size as possible and should not be extremely large. Those which are too large in circumference are likely to have a hollow in the center and are not nearly so desirable as thin, solid ones. Carrots of any kind should be uniform in color, and should be without the green portion that is sometimes found on the top near the stem and that is caused by exposure to the light in growing. 100. In preparing carrots for cooking, they should be scraped rather than peeled, in order to avoid wasting any of the vegetable. They are always cooked in boiling salted water, after which they can be treated in various ways. The water in which carrots are cooked should not be thrown away, as it may be used to flavor soup stock. If any carrots remain after a meal, they may be utilized in vegetable salad or soup. 101. BUTTERED CARROTS.--If small, tender carrots can be obtained, they will be found to be delicious upon being boiled and then dressed with butter. Winter carrots may be prepared in this way too, but they will probably require a little more cooking to make them tender. BUTTERED CARROTS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. diced carrots 2 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Wash and scrape the carrots and cut into half-inch pieces. Put to cook in enough boiling water to cover the carrots well, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. Cook in a covered kettle until they can be easily pierced with a fork and then drain off the water. Add the butter, salt, and pepper, heat until the butter melts, and serve. 102. CARROTS WITH PARSLEY.--The addition of parsley to carrots gives a flavor that improves them very much. This should be chopped fine and added after the carrots have cooked sufficiently. CARROTS WITH PARSLEY (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. sliced carrots 3 Tb. parsley finely chopped 2 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Wash and scrape the carrots, slice in very thin slices, and cook until tender in boiling salted water. Drain and add the chopped parsley, butter, salt, and pepper. Mix carefully so as not to break the slices of carrot. Serve hot. 103. BROWNED CARROTS.--A very appetizing way in which to prepare carrots is to cut them in slices lengthwise, boil them until tender, and then brown them in fat. Wash and scrape the desired number of carrots, cut into slices lengthwise, and if large-sized carrots are used, cut the slices into halves. Cook in boiling salted water until tender and then drain. Melt some fat in a frying pan, place the carrots in the hot fat, and brown first on one side and then on the other, turning the slices carefully so as not to break them. A few minutes before removing the carrots from the frying pan, sprinkle sugar over them and allow the sugar to melt. In removing them to a vegetable dish, pour over them the sirup that forms. Serve hot. CAULIFLOWER AND ITS PREPARATION 104. CAULIFLOWER grows in heads as does cabbage, but only the flower or blossom of the plant is eaten. A head of cauliflower from which the leaves have not been removed is shown in Fig. 8. In flavor and composition this vegetable is similar to cabbage, but its flavor is a little more delicate. Still, cauliflower should always be cooked in an uncovered vessel, as are cabbage and Brussels sprouts, if a strong disagreeable flavor would be avoided. [Illustration: FIG. 8] 105. SELECTION AND COOKING.--Very solid heads of cauliflower that are creamy white in color and free from the black specks or blemishes so common to this vegetable should be selected for cooking. The only care that cauliflower requires before cooking is to keep it in a cool place, for it does not wilt nor decay quickly. To prepare this vegetable for cooking, the white head should be cut from the leaves, which are discarded. Then the head should be placed upside down in a pan of salt water and allowed to soak for an hour in order to drive out the small bugs or worms that are so frequently found in this vegetable. The cauliflower may then be cooked whole or broken apart, but in either case it should be cooked until tender in boiling salted water with the cover removed from the kettle. 106. CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE.--Variety can be secured in the preparation of cauliflower by serving it with a tomato sauce. Besides being very palatable, this is an extremely attractive dish because of the contrast in colors. Chicken gravy may be used instead of tomato sauce, and a most delightful dish is the result. CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 head cauliflower 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 2 c. strained tomato Soak the cauliflower in cold salted water, and then tie it carefully in a piece of cheesecloth and put it to cook in boiling salted water. Cook until tender, but not so long that it will fall to pieces. Take from the water, remove the cheesecloth carefully, and place the cauliflower in a vegetable dish. While the cauliflower is cooking, prepare the sauce by melting the butter in a double boiler, adding the flour, salt, and pepper, and stirring into this the heated strained tomato made by forcing canned or stewed tomatoes through a sieve. Cook until the sauce has thickened and then pour over the cauliflower in the vegetable dish. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 9] 107. SCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER.--Another opportunity to make a delicious scalloped dish is afforded by cauliflower. In fact, many persons prefer scalloped cauliflower to any of the dishes made from this vegetable. The ingredients used with the cauliflower increase its food value, which is somewhat low. SCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 head cauliflower 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 c. milk 1 c. water from cauliflower 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. buttered crumbs Prepare and cook the cauliflower according to the directions given in Art. 105, breaking it into flowerets before pouring the boiling water on it. When it has cooked tender, drain the water from it. Prepare a sauce with the butter, flour, milk, water from the cauliflower, salt, and pepper. Butter the crumbs by pouring 1 tablespoonful of melted butter over them. Put 1/4 cupful of the crumbs on the bottom of a baking dish, add one-half of the cauliflower, and over this place another 1/4 cupful of crumbs. Then add the remainder of the cauliflower, and pour the white sauce over all. Sprinkle the remainder of the crumbs over the top. Place in a hot oven and bake until well heated through and brown on top. Serve from the dish. 108. CREAMED CAULIFLOWER.--A very attractive vegetable dish can be prepared from cauliflower by cooking the head whole and then serving a cream sauce over it, as shown in Fig. 9. In serving, a portion of the head should be broken off for each person and served with a little of the cream sauce. CREAMED CAULIFLOWER (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 head cauliflower 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1 c. milk 1/2 c. water in which cauliflower was cooked 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Soak a solid head of cauliflower in cold salted water for about 1 hour. Then wash thoroughly, wrap carefully in cheesecloth, and cook in boiling salted water until tender. When sufficiently cooked, drain, and make a sauce of the other ingredients. Place the cauliflower in a vegetable dish, pour the white sauce over it, and serve hot. CELERY AND ITS PREPARATION 109. CELERY is the stem of a plant that grows in stalks, as shown in Fig. 10. When the stalks are large, they are sold singly, but if they are very small, several of them are tied together and sold in a bunch. The season for celery begins in the fall and lasts until early spring. It may be obtained in the summer, but as the price is usually high and the quality not good, very little use should be made of it during that time. The chief use of celery is as a relish, when it is eaten raw, but it is also valuable for flavoring soups and making salads, pickles, and various other dishes. It is probably used less frequently as a cooked vegetable than in any other way, but when it is in season and can be purchased at a reasonable price, it should be cooked to give variety to the diet. The food value of celery is extremely low, being less than 100 calories to the pound or about equal to that of 1 ounce of meat. However, in spite of this fact, celery is valuable for its mineral salts and bulk, as well as for the appetizing quality that it lends to various foods and to the meals at which it is served. [Illustration: FIG. 10] 110. CARE AND PREPARATION.--Well-bleached, firm stalks of celery should be selected for use. After it comes into the house, it may be kept in good condition for a long time if it is wrapped in a damp cloth and put where it will keep cool. A good plan is to serve the hearts and tender inside stems raw, as explained in _Soup_, and then to use the coarse outside stems for cooking, flavoring soups, or making salads. Celery must be cleaned carefully for dirt often clings to the ridges. After being scrubbed thoroughly, it will become crisp and tender if it is allowed to stand in cold water for some time before serving. When it is to be served as a cooked vegetable, it should be cooked in boiling salted water, as are other vegetables, and then seasoned or dressed in any desirable way. The water in which it is cooked should be utilized in the making of sauce or soup. 111. CREAMED CELERY.--The usual way of preparing celery when it is to be served as a cooked vegetable is to cream it. The cream sauce that is added to the celery increases its food value considerably and greatly improves its flavor. This sauce may be made entirely of milk or of half milk and half liquid from the celery. CREAMED CELERY (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. diced celery 3 Tb. butter 3 Tb. flour 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. milk 1/2 c. water in which celery was cooked Cook the celery in boiling salted water until tender, and then drain. When the celery has cooked, make a white sauce of the other ingredients. Pour this sauce over the cooked celery, heat together, and serve. 112. CELERY AU GRATIN.--The food value of celery may be still further increased by combining it with cheese and bread crumbs in addition to a cream sauce. Such a dish, which is known as _celery au gratin_, is prepared according to the accompanying recipe. CELERY AU GRATIN (Sufficient to Serve Six) 4 c. diced celery 2-1/2 Tb. butter 2-1/2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. milk 1 c. water in which celery was cooked 1 c. buttered crumbs 1/2 c. grated cheese Cook the celery in boiling salted water until tender and then drain. Prepare the cream sauce in the usual manner. Butter the crumbs by stirring them into 1 tablespoonful of melted butter. Put 1/4 cupful of the crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish and put one-half of the celery over them. Place another 1/4 cupful of the crumbs over the celery, and on top of this sprinkle 1/4 cupful of the grated cheese. Add the remainder of the celery and pour the sauce over this. Finally, add the other 1/4 cupful of cheese and the remainder of the crumbs. Place in a hot oven, and bake until well heated through and the crumbs are browned. Serve hot. CORN AND ITS PREPARATION 113. The seeds of the maize plant, or Indian corn, especially the variety known as _sweet corn_, are eaten as a vegetable when they are immature. They grow on a woody cob, and when they are green they are soft and milky; but when they become ripe they are hard and are then ground as grain. Many varieties of sweet corn are used, but some are better in quality than others. In some varieties, the kernels, or seeds, are yellow, while in others they are white; also, some of them are suitable for use early in the summer, while others come later in the season. However, in spite of this difference in quality, color, and season, all kinds of corn used as a vegetable are called _green corn_ and may be prepared in exactly the same ways. 114. The food value of corn, which is very high, even exceeding that of Irish potatoes, is due principally to the carbohydrate it contains. This food substance is in the form of sugar in the green kernels, but as they mature it changes to starch. The food value of the dry grain is therefore higher, and the carbohydrate is in a different form. When the contents of the kernels is still in the liquid form, the corn is said to be at the _milk stage_, and is generally considered to be too young for table use. On the other hand, when the liquid in the kernels has become thickened, the corn, which is then at the _dough stage_, is thought to be too old for use as a vegetable. To be ideal for culinary purposes, it should be just between the milk and dough stages. Then, if it is in good condition, a most satisfactory vegetable is the result. 115. The ear on which the corn kernels grow is entirely encased in several layers of husks. These are not removed until just before the corn is to be cooked; so when this vegetable is in the market the husks are allowed to remain on the ears. The condition of the ears can be determined by stripping the husks down a little and examining the kernels. If they are well filled, they may be considered to be in proper condition; otherwise, they will not be suitable for cooking. No special care need be given to green corn, provided it is not husked. However, when it has been husked, it should be cooked at once. In the husking of corn, all corn silk that is found inside of the husks should be carefully removed, for this is very annoying in the cooked vegetable and its presence indicates carelessness. 116. CORN ON THE COB.--The simplest way in which to prepare green corn is to cook it on the cob. When corn first comes into the market, it is usually very tender and makes a most satisfactory dish when prepared in this way. To cook corn on the cob, husk the corn, remove the silk from the ears, and place them in a kettle. Pour enough boiling water over them to cover them well, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. Boil 5 minutes, remove from the water, and serve at once. In eating corn on the cob, most persons dress it with butter, pepper, and salt. [Illustration: FIG. 11] 117. CORN COOKED IN MILK.--Often it is not desired to eat corn on the cob. When this is the case, it may be cut off the ear and cooked in various ways. A simple way to prepare it is to cook it with milk and season it with salt, pepper, and butter, as explained in the accompanying recipe. Select the desired number of ears of green corn, husk them, and remove the silk. Then, as shown in Fig. 11, cut the corn from the cob with a sharp knife, grasping the ear by the larger end and cutting upwards. After cutting off the kernels, scrape the ears so that nothing edible will be wasted, drawing the knife downwards. Put the corn into a saucepan, add milk until the corn is nearly covered, and season with salt, pepper, and a little butter. Allow the corn to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan and scorching. No difficulty will be experienced in the preparation of this dish if a double boiler is used, but longer cooking will be required. When the corn is sufficiently cooked, remove from the fire and serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 12] 118. CORN PULP.--Some persons are unable to digest the coarse hulls of green corn, but can eat the corn if the hulls are removed. Such persons need not be deprived of the delights of this vegetable, for it may be prepared in the form of pulp, which will not disagree with them. To prepare corn pulp, first cut a slit down each row of kernels with a sharp knife as shown in Fig. 12; then, in the manner shown in Fig. 13, scrape out the contents of the kernels with the dull edge of the knife, drawing the knife downwards. When all the pulp has been removed, season it with salt, pepper, and butter, and heat it thoroughly in a double boiler. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 13] If it is not desirable to serve the corn pulp in this manner, it may be used in various ways, as the following recipes indicate. A good substitute for corn pulp is canned corn, but this must be chopped in order to break up the hulls. 119. CORN SOUFFL\\u00c9.--No more delightful corn dish can be prepared than corn souffl\\u00e9, for in addition to its being appetizing and nutritious, it is extremely dainty. It may be cooked in a baking dish, but it is more attractive when baked in individual baking dishes. A point to remember about its preparation is that it should be served immediately upon being taken from the oven, for souffl\\u00e9 always shrinks as it cools. CORN SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. green corn pulp 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 2 Tb. melted butter 2 Tb. flour 1/4 c. milk 2 eggs Mix the corn pulp, salt, pepper, and melted butter, stir in the flour, and add the milk. Separate the eggs, beat the yolks, and add them to the mixture. Then beat the whites stiff and fold them in. Pour into a buttered baking dish or into individual baking dishes, set in a pan of hot water, and bake until brown. Serve at once. 120. CORN OYSTERS.--Variety can be secured in the use of corn by making corn oysters. These get their name from the fact that they resemble oysters in both size and shape. They may be served as a garnish for a meat dish or as a vegetable dish. CORN OYSTERS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. corn pulp 1 egg 1/4 c. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1/2 tsp. baking powder Prepare the corn pulp according to the directions given in Art. 118. To this add the beaten egg, flour, salt, pepper, and baking powder. Drop in tablespoonfuls on a well-greased griddle. When brown on one side, turn and brown on the other side. Then fold through the center, doubling one side over the other. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 14] 121. CORN FRITTERS.--The popularity of corn fritters, which have corn pulp as their foundation, is undoubtedly due both to their flavor and to the variety they afford in the diet. After being fried, corn fritters should appear as shown in Fig. 14. They may be served plain, but most persons prefer them with a sauce of some kind or with maple sirup. CORN FRITTERS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. corn pulp, or 1 can corn, chopped 1 c. flour 1 tsp. baking powder 1 tsp. salt 2 eggs If canned corn is used, drain off the liquid before using it. To the corn, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs and stir in the beaten yolks. Beat the whites stiff and fold them into the mixture. Drop with a spoon into deep fat, fry until brown, remove from the fat, and drain on paper. Serve plain, with a desired sauce, or with maple sirup. CUCUMBERS AND THEIR PREPARATION 122. The hard-rinded fruit of the cucumber plant has been used from time immemorial as a vegetable. In food value, cucumbers are very low, comparing closely with celery in this respect; however, as they contain a large amount of cellulose, or bulk, and mineral salts, they should not be disregarded in the diet. They have a rather strong flavor due to their volatile oils, which so frequently disagree with persons and which give cucumbers a reputation for being difficult to digest. However, when they are properly prepared, they can be eaten by most persons without harm. [Illustration: FIG. 15] 123. Formerly it was the custom to soak slices of cucumber in salt water before serving them. This procedure, however, has been found to be poor policy, for nothing is gained by it and the salt toughens the cellulose and makes the cucumbers limp and rubbery in texture. A much more satisfactory way to prepare cucumbers is to slice them and then soak them for some time before serving in ice water or water as cold as can be obtained. They will then become crisp and delicious, and, besides being more appetizing and agreeable, they will be no less digestible. After being sliced and chilled, cucumbers are often combined with sliced onions and eaten with vinegar, salt, and pepper, or they are eaten alone or on lettuce, dressed with mayonnaise dressing. 124. STUFFED CUCUMBERS.--Possibly the only recipe for cooked cucumbers that is used to any extent is the accompanying one for stuffed cucumbers. Cucumbers prepared in this way are very palatable, and because of the ingredients used are much higher in food value than when eaten alone. Such a dish is attractive, too, as Fig. 15 shows. STUFFED CUCUMBERS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 cucumbers 2 Tb. butter 1 small onion, chopped 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1-1/2 c. steamed rice 1 c. stewed tomatoes Bread crumbs Select medium-sized cucumbers, wash and peel them, and cut them in half lengthwise. Hollow out the center so that the cucumbers will have the shape of boats. Then melt the butter in a frying pan, add the chopped onion, salt, and pepper, and heat together for a few minutes. Next add the rice, tomatoes, and sufficient bread crumbs to take up any excess of moisture. Fill the cucumbers with this mixture and bake until they are soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork. During the first part of the cooking, pour a small amount of hot water into the pan in which the cucumbers are baked. Serve hot. EGGPLANT AND ITS PREPARATION 125. EGGPLANT belongs to the class of fruit vegetables, and is closely related to the tomato in structure and composition. It grows rather large in size, is covered with a smooth brownish-purple skin, and is made up of material that is close and firm in texture and creamy white in color. Because of the nature of its structure, eggplant would seem to be high in food value, but, on the contrary, this vegetable has very little. In this respect, it is about equal to cabbage and cauliflower and slightly less than string beans. 126. Eggplant is found in the market from early summer until the beginning of winter. Because it is protected by a heavy skin, it keeps well and needs no special care in storage. The strong flavor of the pulp is disagreeable to many persons. However, it has been found that much of this flavor may be removed by soaking the eggplant in strong salt water or by sprinkling it with salt after it has been sliced and then allowing it to stand for some time. It may be prepared in a variety of ways; so, if the members of the family care for it, the housewife will find it of great assistance in planning and preparing meals. 127. SAUT\\u00c9D EGGPLANT.--The usual way of preparing eggplant is to cut it into slices and then saut\\u00e9 it. As the slices are dipped into beaten egg and then into crumbs before saut\\u00e9ing, the food value of this vegetable is increased and its flavor improved. Peel the eggplant and then cut it into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle salt over the slices and let them stand for 1 hour or more; then pour off the juice that has collected. Beat an egg slightly, and to it add a few tablespoonfuls of milk or water. Dip the slices of eggplant first into the beaten egg and then into crumbs. When sufficiently coated, saut\\u00e9 in shallow fat, browning first on one side and then on the other. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 16] 128. BAKED EGGPLANT.--An attractive dish can be made by removing the contents from an eggplant, filling the cavity with a well-seasoned stuffing, and then baking the stuffed eggplant. When an eggplant is prepared in this way, it will appear as in Fig. 16. BAKED EGGPLANT (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 medium-sized eggplant 2 c. dried bread crumbs 1/2 c. milk 2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1 small onion, chopped 1 Tb. parsley 2 Tb. butter Wash the eggplant and cook in boiling water for about 10 minutes. Remove from the water, cut off the top, scoop out the contents, and chop it into small pieces. With this finely chopped pulp, mix the bread crumbs, milk, salt, pepper, onion, parsley, and melted butter. When the whole is thoroughly blended, pack it into the shell of the eggplant and place in the oven. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the stuffing is thoroughly cooked and the top is brown. Serve hot. 129. SCALLOPED EGGPLANT.--If it is desired to increase the food value of eggplant and improve its flavor too, this vegetable should be scalloped. The accompanying recipe carefully followed will produce a most appetizing dish. SCALLOPED EGGPLANT (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 medium-sized eggplant 1 c. dried crumbs 2 Tb. butter 2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1-1/2 c. milk Peel the eggplant and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Put into a saucepan, cover with boiling salted water, cook until tender, and then drain. Grease a baking dish, spread 1/4 cupful of crumbs on the bottom, and add one-half of the eggplant. Dot with butter and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add another 1/4 cupful of crumbs and the remaining eggplant, dot again with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the milk over the whole and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cupful of crumbs on the top. Place in the oven and bake for 1/2 hour or more. Serve hot. FRENCH ARTICHOKES AND THEIR PREPARATION 130. FRENCH ARTICHOKES, sometimes known as _globe artichokes, California artichokes_, and _cardoons_, are related to the family of thistles. They are grown for the sake of their large flower-heads, or buds, which are shown in Fig. 17 and which are much used as a food. These plants stand storage and shipment very well and may be kept for long periods of time without spoiling. It is therefore possible to transport them considerable distances, a very gratifying fact, since most persons consider artichokes a great delicacy. 131. Not all of the artichoke plant is eaten. The portions of the flower that develop in the center of the base are removed before the base is eaten. After the artichokes are cooked, the scales, or leaves, are pulled from the cooked head with the fingers and the lower part of each one is dipped into sauce and eaten. The inner scales are much more tender and edible than the coarse outside ones. Although artichokes find favor with many and are considered somewhat of a delicacy, they are low in food value, being about equal to asparagus in this respect. To add food material, a dressing, such as drawn-butter sauce or mayonnaise dressing, is usually served. [Illustration: FIG. 17] 132. ARTICHOKES WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.--The usual method of preparing artichokes is to boil them and then serve them with melted butter or a sauce. Hollandaise dressing is used with the artichokes shown in Fig. 18. Boiled artichokes may also be cooled and then served with a salad dressing. Secure the desired number of artichokes and prepare them for boiling by pulling off the coarse outside leaves, cutting off the top of the bud, and removing the stem close to the bud. Cover well with boiling water, add 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart, and boil until tender, or for about 45 minutes. Remove from the water and serve hot with melted butter or Hollandaise sauce. If it is desired to use them for a salad, allow them to cool before adding the salad dressing.

Varieties of Greens.--The leaves and stems of many young plants in either their wild or their cultivated form are used for food. All of them are similar in composition, but many of them differ in flavor and appearance. The cultivated ones include beet tops, endive, spinach, and kale, as well as lettuce, collards, Swiss chard, sorrel, mustard greens, turnip tops, parsley, and cultivated cress and dandelion. The four greens mentioned first are illustrated in Fig. 1, beet tops being shown in the lower right corner; endive, in the upper right corner; spinach, in the lower left corner; and kale, in the upper left corner. Commonest among the wild greens are dandelion, cress, wild mustard, dock, pokeweed sprouts, milkweed sprouts, and lamb's-quarters. Most of these wild varieties are excellent in the spring when they are young and tender, but it is not advisable to use them for food unless one is perfectly familiar with their appearance. 2. Food Value of Greens.--The food value of all greens with the exception of dandelion is very low, being just about equal to that of celery and cucumbers. This may be increased in their preparation by the addition of other food materials. However, the chief use of greens in the diet is not to supply food value, but mineral salts, the most important one being iron in a form that is necessary for building up the blood. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING GREENS 3. The cooking of greens, both wild and cultivated, is not only simple but practically the same for all varieties. When they are not used as a salad vegetable, they are merely boiled until tender and then dressed in any desired way. Some kinds admit of special preparation, and wherever this is the case specific directions are given under the particular variety, but even in such an event the preliminary preparation is the same. [Illustration: FIG. 1] To prepare greens, look them over carefully, remove any decayed or withered parts, cut off the leaves, and wash in fresh cold water. Remove from the water and wash again, and do this as many times as seems necessary to remove all the sand and grit that the stalks contain. An important point to remember is that the greens should not be cleansed by pouring the water off, as the sand will then remain in the pan and is likely to mix with the greens again. When they are thoroughly washed, put them on to cook in a saucepan or a similar utensil. If they are young and tender, they should be cooked as much as possible in their own juice in order to retain all the valuable mineral salts they contain, only enough water being added to start the cooking without burning. In the case of greens that are very strong in flavor, it will be necessary to cook them in a larger quantity of water and then pour off what remains after cooking. When they have cooked until they are tender, season them if necessary, and add butter to give them flavor and increase their food value. Vinegar or a slice of lemon adds much to the flavor of greens. BEET TOPS 4. The tops of beets include the leaves and the stems of this vegetable, as Fig. 1 shows. They are at their best when the beets are very young or before the beets themselves have developed. Beet tops are not used so extensively as some greens, but they will be found to have a more agreeable flavor than many greens that are more popular. Beets are raised for the purpose of supplying greens by planting the seeds closely enough together to form a thick bed of leaves and then thinning them out before the beets have developed. A few may be allowed to remain and develop for use as beets. Young beets that are purchased with the tops on also furnish a source of beet tops as well as beets. When beet tops are to be cooked, cut the stems into inch lengths and use them with the leaves. Proceed to clean and cook the greens according to the directions given in Art. 3. Season with salt and pepper and flavor with butter. Serve with something tart, such as vinegar or lemon. DANDELION 5. Dandelion, both wild and cultivated, is a plant whose leaves are much used for a vegetable green before the blossoms develop. The wild ones have the advantage of being cheap, so they should be used if they can be secured; the cultivated ones, on the other hand, cost as much as spinach and other greens. The season for dandelions is comparatively short, lasting only a few weeks in the early spring. Use should therefore be made of them when they can be procured in order to secure variety for the menu. When they are desired as cooked greens, prepare them in the manner explained in Art. 3. 6. Dandelion With Sour Sauce.--If a change in the cooking of dandelion is desired, it should be prepared with a sour sauce. This method of preparation is very popular, for besides increasing the food value of this variety of greens, it improves the flavor very much. DANDELION WITH SOUR SAUCE (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1/2 pk. dandelion 1/2 c. vinegar 4 thin slices bacon 1/2 c. water 2 Tb. flour 1 egg 1 tsp. salt Clean and wash the dandelion. Cut the slices of bacon into small pieces and saut\\u00e9 until crisp. Stir the flour and salt into the bacon fat, add the vinegar and water, and stir until the flour thickens. Add the beaten egg last, and remove from the fire. Put the dandelion into the pan and mix well with the hot sauce. If the dandelion is preferred well wilted, set the pan over the flame, and stir until the dandelion appears as desired. Serve hot. ENDIVE 7. ENDIVE is an herb that is used as a salad plant or is cooked and served with a hot dressing or as greens. The three common varieties of this green are escarole, chicory, and French endive, all of which have a slightly bitter taste and may be found in the market from late summer until early winter. _Escarole_ is a broad-leaved variety that is grown more or less in a head. _Chicory_, which is shown in Fig. 1, has a small feathery-edged leaf, and is often bleached by tying the leaves together at the top, so that the inside ones are very tender. Both of these varieties may be cooked, but they are also much used for salads. _French endive_ bears very little resemblance to the other kinds, having straight, creamy-white leaves that are closely pressed together. It looks very much like sprouts of some kind, and is entirely bleached in the process of growth by banking the earth around it. It is never used for anything except salads and garnishes. 8. Endive is very low in food value, comparing very closely with celery and cucumbers in this respect. Still, as a salad vegetable, it is worthy of much more extensive use than is generally made of it. As a rule, its price is about the same as that of lettuce, so it should be substituted frequently for lettuce to give variety to the diet. To be most satisfactory, endive should be bought when it is fresh and unwithered and kept until used in a cool, damp place. A good plan is to wrap such vegetables in a damp cloth. If, upon using, endive appears to be withered, it may be freshened by placing it in a pan of cold water and allowing it to remain there for a short time. When endive is used as a salad, it may be served merely with a salad dressing of some kind or it may be combined with other vegetables before applying the dressing. Escarole and chicory, which are much used as greens, should be prepared and cooked according to the directions given in Art. 3. LETTUCES 9. Lettuce is a well-known herb that is much used as a salad vegetable. There are numerous varieties of lettuce, but these may be reduced to the two kinds shown in Fig. 2, _leaf lettuce_ on the right and _head lettuce_ on the left. Leaf lettuce, which is more often used for garnishing than for any other purpose, has firm, crisp, green, upright leaves; on the other hand, head lettuce has round leaves forming a compact head, like cabbage. The outside leaves of head lettuce are green, but the inside ones are usually bleached by the exclusion of light, as are those of cabbage and endive. These inside leaves are more tender than the others, and hence more to be desired as a salad vegetable than the unbleached variety. In food value, lettuce compares closely with other varieties of greens and is high in the same mineral salts that they are. The bleached leaves do not contain so much iron as the green ones. [Illustration: FIG. 2] 10. As has already been implied, lettuce finds its principal use in garnishing salads. When used for this purpose, it should be eaten along with the salad, for it is too valuable to be wasted. Since the coarse outside leaves of a stalk or a head of lettuce do not look so well as the tender bleached ones, they are often rejected, but this should not be done, for use can also be made of them. For instance, such leaves may be shredded into narrow strips and used as a foundation for salads that will be just as attractive as those having a single lettuce leaf for a garnish. When it is realized that the outside leaves are purchased at the same price as the more delicate parts of the lettuce, it can readily be understood why they also should be utilized as food. Most of the garden varieties of lettuce, especially when they have grown very large, are frequently cooked as greens. When used in this way, lettuce is prepared, as are other greens, according to the directions given in Art. 3. This vegetable also makes an appetizing dish when it is prepared with a sauce and served hot in the same way as dandelion. SPINACH 11. SPINACH, which is shown in Fig. 1, consists of the large, fleshy, deep-green leaves of a garden herb much used as a green for food. In fact, this is one of the most popular varieties of greens and is used more extensively than any other. Many varieties of spinach are grown, but all of them are used in just the same way. It is slightly higher in food value than lettuce and endive, but lower than dandelion. However, it is a valuable food in the diet because of the large quantity of iron it contains, and many persons eat it not so much because they like it but because they believe it is good for them. [Illustration: FIG. 3] 12. Some kinds of spinach do not keep for long periods of time. Therefore, in order to avoid any waste, spinach should always be very fresh when purchased and should be used as soon as possible after it is obtained. It may be prepared in a greater number of ways than most of the other greens except, perhaps, those used for salads. For instance, it is served with entr\\u00e9es of various kinds, is combined with meat, ham and spinach being a much used combination, or is made into a pur\\u00e9e by forcing it through a sieve and then used in the making of soup or souffl\\u00e9. Then, again, spinach is often boiled and pressed into small cups to form molds like the one shown in Fig. 3. Such a mold may be used to garnish a dish of some sort or, as here shown, may be garnished with a slice of hard-cooked egg. When spinach is used in any of these ways, it should first be cooked according to the directions given for the preparation of greens in Art. 3. 13. SPINACH SOUFFL\\u00c9.--The pur\\u00e9e that is made by forcing boiled spinach through a sieve may be used in a variety of ways, but none of these is more satisfactory than spinach souffl\\u00e9. When made according to the accompanying recipe, spinach souffl\\u00e9 will be found to be appetizing as well as nourishing. SPINACH SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 Tb. butter 1/2 c. hot milk 2 Tb. flour 1 c. spinach pur\\u00e9e 1 tsp. salt 2 egg whites Dash of pepper Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, pepper, and hot milk, and stir in the spinach pur\\u00e9e. Beat the egg whites stiff and fold them into the mixture. Grease individual baking dishes or a large baking dish and fill two-thirds full with the mixture. Place in a pan of hot water and bake in a slow oven until firm, or for about 20 or 30 minutes. [Illustration: FIG. 4] 14. SPINACH ROYAL.--A very attractive dish can be made by combining spinach with toast, hard-cooked egg, and lemon in the manner shown in Fig. 4. This dish is known as _spinach royal_, and because of the additional ingredients it is nutritious as well as palatable. SPINACH ROYAL (Sufficient to Serve Four) 1/2 pk. spinach 1/3 c. water 1-1/2 tsp. salt 3 Tb. bacon fat or butter 3 Tb. flour 1/8 tsp. pepper Triangular pieces of toast 2 hard-cooked eggs 1 lemon Look the spinach over carefully and remove all roots and dead leaves. Cut the stalks apart and wash them thoroughly several times in fresh, clean water to remove the sand and dirt, lifting the spinach out of the water each time instead of pouring the water off. Put the spinach into a saucepan with the water. Stir frequently until the spinach is wilted and there is sufficient water to boil it. Add 1 teaspoonful of the salt and cook until the leaves are very tender, or for about 15 or 20 minutes. Drain off all but about 1/2 cupful of the liquid. Melt the fat in a frying pan, stir the flour into it, brown to a golden brown, and then add the spinach, pepper, and remaining salt. Stir and cook until the flour has thickened and mixed well with the spinach. Turn out in a mound on a platter and place the pieces of toast around the spinach as shown. Slice the hard-cooked eggs, cut the lemon into any desirable shape, and use these to garnish the platter. In serving this dish, put a spoonful of spinach on a piece of toast and serve a slice or two of egg and lemon with each portion. 15. CREAMED SPINACH.--After spinach has been boiled until it is tender, it may be made more appetizing by combining it with a well-flavored cream sauce, according to the accompanying directions. CREAMED SPINACH (Sufficient to Serve Four) 1/2 pk. spinach 1/2 tsp. salt 2 Tb. ham or bacon fat Dash of pepper 2 Tb. flour 2/3 c. milk Boil the spinach according to the directions given in Art. 3. Melt the fat in a frying pan, add the flour, salt, pepper, and milk, and stir until the flour thickens. Chop the cooked spinach and add it to the hot dressing. Stir and cook until the two are well blended. Serve hot. WATERCRESS AND PARSLEY 16. WATERCRESS and PARSLEY are two herbs, or greens, that are used considerably for garnishing and flavoring other dishes. These greens are shown in Fig. 5, that at the left being watercress and that at the right parsley. 17. Watercress, which is commonly known as _peppercress_, usually grows wild in beds along the banks of springs or clear, cool streams. A few varieties, however, are cultivated, and these are grown in dry soil and known as _upland cress_. It is a very prolific herb, and may be obtained from early spring until late in the fall; in fact, it does not freeze easily and is sometimes found in early winter along the swiftly flowing streams that are not frozen over. Watercress may be used whenever it can be procured, but it is not very desirable when in blossom. Its chief use is to garnish salads and other dishes, but it may also be cooked and served hot as a green. In such an event, its cooking is accomplished in the same way as that of other greens. [Illustration: FIG. 5] 18. Parsley, while classified as a green vegetable, is perhaps not in the true sense of the word a real vegetable, since it is used for only two purposes, and in neither of these is it served cooked or raw as an exclusive article of diet. The most important use of parsley is perhaps that of flavoring. It is added to soups, sauces, and various kinds of cooked vegetables in order to impart additional flavor. In such cases, it should be chopped very fine in order that all possible flavor may be extracted from it. Parsley may also be dried before it is used for this purpose, provided it must be kept for any length of time. The other use of parsley is that of garnishing. It is often used in small sprays to garnish a roast of meat, a steak, chops, fish, or some baked, fried, or saut\\u00e9d vegetable. Sometimes it is chopped very fine and placed around the edge of a patty shell, a croustade, a timbale case, or a piece of toast upon which food is served. Parsley may be eaten when it is served as a garnish if its flavor is found to be agreeable to the taste. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AND THEIR PREPARATION 19. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES are tubers belonging to the sunflower family. In appearance they resemble potatoes to some extent, but, as a rule, they are neither so large nor so smooth. The inside texture of this vegetable is more moist and not so mealy as that of the Irish potato. Jerusalem artichokes are easy to grow and are very prolific, so that if any one is fond of them they will be found to be a profitable crop. For table use, they are prepared in much the same way as potatoes. 20. CREAMED ARTICHOKES.--A common method of preparing Jerusalem artichokes is to cream them. Wash and peel the desired number of artichokes and cut them into 1/2-inch dice. Put these to cook in boiling salted water and cook until tender enough to be pierced with a fork. Drain off the water and dress with hot medium white sauce. Serve hot. 21. BUTTERED ARTICHOKES.--Another satisfactory way in which to prepare Jerusalem artichokes is to dress them with butter. Wash and peel the required number of artichokes and cut them into slices. Put these to cook in boiling salted water and cook until tender enough to be pierced with a fork. Drain off the water and dress with melted butter to which has been added a little chopped parsley. Serve hot. KOHLRABI AND ITS PREPARATION 22. KOHLRABI is a variety of cabbage having a turnip-shaped stem. On account of its shape it is often called _turnip cabbage_. The edible part of kohlrabi is the enlarged stem, which has the flavor of both turnip and cabbage. The stems of the leaves are attached to the enlarged portion that is used for food, and these must be removed in the preparation of the vegetable. Kohlrabi is not a perishable vegetable and therefore stands storage very well. For market, it is usually placed in bunches and tied as are beets and carrots. In food value, this vegetable, like cabbage, is somewhat low. The food value it does have is carbohydrate in the form of sugar. 23. After the stems of the leaves have been cut off, the kohlrabi should be washed and then pared to remove the outer skin. It is usually diced or sliced thin, and then cooked and dressed in any desirable way. This vegetable, like cabbage, cauliflower, etc., should be cooked with the cover removed from the kettle, in order to allow some of the flavor to escape in the steam. Kohlrabi that is old or that has been in storage for some time develops woody portions as do turnips, beets, and other winter vegetables, and must therefore be cooked sufficiently long to make it palatable. 24. BOILED KOHLRABI.--Persons fond of kohlrabi as a vegetable will undoubtedly prefer it merely boiled and flavored with butter, pepper, and salt. When it is to be cooked in this way, prepare it in the manner just explained. Then put it on to cook in sufficient boiling salted water to cover it well, and allow it to cook with the cover removed until it can be easily pierced with a fork. When sufficiently cooked, pour off the water, season to taste with salt and pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each pint of kohlrabi cooked. Serve hot. 25. MASHED KOHLRABI.--As turnips and potatoes are often boiled and then mashed, so kohlrabi makes a very appetizing dish when prepared in this way. Prepare the kohlrabi and cook it by boiling. When it has cooked soft, drain off the water and mash with a wooden or a wire potato masher. Season with salt and pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each pint of cooked vegetable. Serve hot. 26. CREAMED KOHLRABI.--The preparation of kohlrabi can be varied by serving it with a cream sauce. Such a sauce also increases the food value of this vegetable by supplying the substances in which it is low. CREAMED KOHLRABI (Sufficient to Serve Six) 4 c. diced kohlrabi 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. milk Cook the kohlrabi in boiling salted water until tender and then drain the water from it. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, salt, and pepper, and into this stir the hot milk. Cook until the sauce has thickened. Then pour it over the kohlrabi and reheat. Serve hot. LENTILS AND THEIR PREPARATION 27. LENTILS are the flattish, circular, dried seeds of an annual vine grown chiefly in Europe and Asia. They belong to the class of vegetables known as legumes, and are therefore high in protein in the form of legumin. They also contain a large amount of carbohydrate in the form of starch and are high in mineral salts. Because of their high food value, which is somewhat over 1,600 calories to the pound, they are a valuable food in the diet, particularly as a meat substitute. Consequently, when lentils can be obtained at a reasonable price, it is wise to make considerable use of them. There are three varieties of lentils, _yellow_, _red_, and _black_, and they resemble split peas in appearance, as will be observed from Fig. 6, which shows a panful of dried lentils. They have a distinctive flavor that is agreeable to most persons. However, like other dried legumes, long cooking is required to make them tender and palatable. 28. COOKING OF LENTILS.--In general, the preparation of lentils is similar to that of dried beans, the cooking of which is now thoroughly understood. They may be put on to cook immediately after they are washed, but, as in the case of dried beans, their cooking may be hastened if they are first softened by soaking them in cold water for 8 to 12 hours. At the end of this time, it is advisable to parboil the lentils for about 10 or 15 minutes, or until their outer skins begin to crack, in water to which a pinch of soda has been added. This water being poured off, the lentils should be washed and then put to cook in fresh water to which 1 teaspoonful of salt is added for each quart of water used. Like beans, the lentils should be cooked slowly until they are soft enough to crush between the fingers. With these principles for the cooking of lentils well in mind, the housewife will have no difficulty in preparing this vegetable, for almost any of the recipes given for dried beans may be used with lentils substituted for the beans. [Illustration: FIG. 6] 29. LENTIL PUFF.--A decided change from the usual ways of preparing lentils can be had by making lentil puff. Black lentils are used for this preparation, and they are made into a pur\\u00e9e before being used in the puff. If the accompanying recipe is carefully followed, a most appetizing, as well as nutritious, dish will be the result. LENTIL PUFF (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1-1/4 c. lentil pur\\u00e9e 1-1/2 c. riced potatoes 2 Tb. butter 1/2 c. milk 1-1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 eggs Soak the lentils overnight in water that contains a pinch of soda, parboil them for about 10 minutes, and pour off the water. Put them to cook in cold water and cook until they are tender, allowing the water to evaporate completely, if possible, so that the pur\\u00e9e made from them will be dry. However, if any water remains when the lentils are done, pour it off and use it for soup or sauce. Make the pur\\u00e9e by forcing the cooked lentils through a colander. If it is found to be too wet, less milk can be used than the recipe calls for. Cook several potatoes and rice them by forcing them through a colander or a ricer. Combine the lentils and potatoes, and to this mixture add the butter, milk, salt, and pepper. Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks slightly and the whites until stiff. Stir the yolks into the mixture and, just before putting the puff into the oven, fold in the whites. Pour into a buttered baking dish, set in the oven, and bake until the puff is set and the surface is brown. Serve hot. MUSHROOMS AND THEIR PREPARATION 30. Mushrooms are not a vegetable; still they are included in this Section because they are used like a vegetable. In reality, they are a fungus growth containing no chlorophyl, or green coloring matter, and, as shown in Fig. 7, consisting of an erect stalk that supports a cap-like expansion. They occur in many varieties, both poisonous and non-poisonous. The non-poisonous, or edible, mushrooms are found on rich, moist pastures all over the world and they are also very frequently cultivated. They may be collected in almost any locality, but no person who is not perfectly familiar with their characteristics and therefore able to judge the non-poisonous kinds from the poisonous should attempt to gather them. Fresh mushrooms can usually be found in the markets, but as they are expensive, they should be considered a luxury and used only occasionally. Instead, some of the small canned varieties, which are usually satisfactory for most purposes, should be used when mushrooms are desired and the wild ones cannot be secured. 31. In food value, mushrooms are not very high, being about equal to beets or carrots in this respect; but they have a higher percentage of protein than these vegetables and they contain extractives similar to those found in meat. To increase their food value, mushrooms are often combined with other foods, such as peas, chestnuts, diced meats, and fowl, and made into dishes of various sorts. Then, again, they are served as a garnish with steaks and other meat dishes. In short, if they can be secured from the surrounding neighborhood or the price is not prohibitive, they should be used in the many excellent ways that are devised for their preparation. 32. PREPARATION FOR COOKING.--To prepare mushrooms for cooking, clean them by brushing them carefully with a soft brush, by scraping the surface, and, in some cases, by removing the stems. Do not, however, throw the stems away, for they may be used as well as the caps. If the mushrooms are found to be tough, the skin should be peeled off. After being thus prepared, mushrooms may be cooked in various ways, as is explained in the accompanying recipes. [Illustration: FIG. 7] 33. BROILED MUSHROOMS.--One of the simplest methods of cooking mushrooms is to broil them. This may be done either by exposing them directly to the heat or by pan-broiling them. In this recipe, only the caps are used. Clean the mushrooms that are to be broiled and remove the stems. Place the caps in a broiler that has been greased or in a slightly greased frying pan. Brown them on one side, then turn them and brown them on the other side. Remove to a platter, dot with butter, season with salt and pepper, and serve. 34. STEWED MUSHROOMS.--Another very simple way in which to cook mushrooms is to stew them and then serve them on toast. When prepared by this method, both the stems and the caps are utilized. Clean the mushrooms and cut both the caps and the stems into small pieces. Cook until tender in sufficient water, stock, or milk to cover them well, and then season with salt and pepper. To the liquid that remains, add enough flour to thicken it slightly. Serve on toast. 35. SAUT\\u00c9D MUSHROOMS.--When mushrooms are saut\\u00e9d, they are often used with other dishes, particularly broiled steak, to improve the flavor and give variety. In fact, steak smothered with mushrooms is considered a luxury. However, saut\\u00e9d mushrooms are very frequently served alone or, together with a sauce made from the fat in which they are cooked, they are served on toast. Clean the mushrooms, remove the stems, and dredge both stems and caps with flour. Melt fat in the frying pan and place the dredged mushrooms in it. Saut\\u00e9 until brown on both sides and season with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Serve in any desired manner. If sauce is desired, add water or stock to the flour and fat that remain in the frying pan, and allow this to cook for a few minutes. 36. CREAMED MUSHROOMS AND CHESTNUTS.--No more delightful combination can be imagined than mushrooms and chestnuts. When combined with a cream sauce and served in patty shells or timbale cases, a dish suitable for the daintiest meal is the result. Another very attractive way in which to serve this combination is to place it in a baking dish, or, as shown in Fig. 8, in individual baking dishes, cover it with a layer of biscuit or pastry crust, bake, and serve it as a pie. CREAMED MUSHROOMS AND CHESTNUTS (Sufficient to Serve Eight) 1-1/2 c. stewed chestnuts 1-1/2 c. stewed mushrooms 3 Tb. butter 3 Tb. flour 1-1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1-1/2 c. milk Remove the shells from the required number of Italian chestnuts and cook the nut meats in boiling water until tender. Peel off the skins and break the chestnuts into pieces. If fresh mushrooms are used, stew them in boiling water until tender. Cut the stewed or canned mushrooms into pieces of the same size as the chestnuts, and mix the two together. Make a cream sauce by melting the butter, adding the flour, salt, and pepper, and stirring in the hot milk. Cook until the mixture thickens, pour it over the chestnuts and mushrooms, and serve in any of the ways suggested. OKRA AND ITS PREPARATION [Illustration: FIG. 9] 37. OKRA is a fruit vegetable consisting of a green pod that is several inches long, pointed at one end, and filled with seeds. Fig. 9 shows okra pods attached to the herb of which they are a part. Although okra originated in Africa, it is for the most part grown in the southern section of the United States. However, canned okra may be obtained almost anywhere. Okra is low in food value, being only slightly higher than cabbage and most of the greens; nevertheless, it is liked by many persons. It is of a mucilaginous, or gummy, consistency, and if it is not properly cooked it becomes very slimy and is then decidedly unpleasant. Because of its gummy nature, it helps to thicken any dish to which it is added. Probably its chief use is as an ingredient in soups, when it is known as _gumbo_. Chicken gumbo soup is one of the most popular dishes of this kind. The preliminary preparation of okra is the same as that of most other vegetables; that is, the pods should be washed, the stems removed, and the cleaned pods then cooked in sufficient boiling salted water to cover them well. 38. STEWED OKRA.--The simplest way in which to prepare okra is to stew it. When seasoned well with salt, pepper, and butter, stewed okra finds much favor with those who care for this vegetable. Select the required number of okra pods and put them on to cook in enough boiling salted water to cover them well. Cook until the pods are soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Season with pepper and, if necessary, additional salt, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. 39. OKRA WITH TOMATOES.--If one does not desire a dish made entirely of okra, it may be combined with tomatoes. Such a combination, seasoned well and flavored with ham or bacon fat, makes a very tasty dish. OKRA WITH TOMATOES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1-1/2 c. stewed or canned okra 1-1/2 c. stewed or canned tomatoes 1-1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. ham or bacon fat Heat the okra and tomatoes together in a saucepan and add the salt, pepper, and ham or bacon fat. Cook for 5 or 10 minutes or until well blended. Serve hot. ONIONS AND THEIR PREPARATION VARIETIES OF THE ONION FAMILY 40. ONIONS are the chief commercial vegetable of the bulb crops. They have been cultivated from the earliest times, their native country being Central Asia. Closely allied to the onion are several other bulb vegetables, including garlic, shallots, leeks, and chives, all of which are used more extensively for flavoring dishes than for any other purpose. Fig. 10 shows several varieties of this family, the group of three in the upper right corner being garlic; the bunch in the lower right corner, leeks; the bunch in the lower left corner, green onions; and the remainder of those shown in the illustration, different varieties of dried onions, that is, onions that have been allowed to mature. 41. This entire class of food is characterized by a typical, volatile oil, which in most cases is so strong as to be somewhat irritating and which causes the vegetable to disagree with many persons. This flavor, however, can be almost entirely dissipated by cooking, so that many persons who cannot eat the various members of the onion family raw can tolerate them cooked. In food value, which is found principally as carbohydrate in the form of sugar, this class of foods is not very high, being about the same as carrots, beets, and other root vegetables. Some persons believe that onions have wonderful medicinal value in curing colds and preventing them, but there is really no foundation for such a belief. [Illustration: Fig. 10] 42. ONIONS.--As has been pointed out, onions are of two general varieties, dried and green. _Dried onions_, as shown in Fig. 10, are those which have been allowed to grow to maturity and have then been cured, or dried, to a certain extent. Such onions are in demand at all seasons. _Green onions_, also shown in Fig. 10, are those which are pulled, or taken out of the ground, before they have matured and are eaten while fresh. They are especially popular in the spring, although they have a rather long season. Each of these classes has many varieties, which vary in flavor and in color, some of the dried ones being yellow, some red, and others white. All dried onions have excellent keeping qualities, so, after purchasing, no special care need be given to them except to store them in a comparatively cool, dry place. Deterioration is due chiefly to sprouting, for as soon as the new plant begins to grow from the center of the onion, the remainder becomes soft and loses much of its flavor. The green, immature onions, however, will not keep for any length of time, and in order to keep them fresh until they are used, they must be stored in a cool, damp place. [Illustration: FIG. 11] 43. GARLIC.--The variety of onion known as garlic is very much desired by the people of southern Europe, where it originated. As Fig. 10 shows, it resembles the onion in appearance, but it consists of several parts, or small bulbs, called _cloves_, which are encased in a covering of thin white skin. Garlic has a very strong penetrating odor and a biting taste that resemble the odor and taste of onion, but that are much ranker. It is little used by Americans except as a flavoring for salads and various kinds of highly seasoned meats. In reality, a very small amount of garlic is sufficient to lend enough flavor, and so the bowl in which a salad is served is often merely rubbed with garlic before the salad is put into it. No difficulty will be experienced in recognizing garlic in the markets, for here it is found in long strings that are made by braiding the dry stems together. 44. SHALLOTS.--Closely allied to garlic are shallots, which are native to Syria, where they still grow wild. They are said to have been brought into Europe by the Crusaders. The bulbs of this vegetable are similar to those of garlic, being compound in form, but instead of being enclosed in a thin covering, they are separate when mature, as Fig. 11 shows. Shallots have a strong flavor, but it is not so rank as that of garlic, nor does the odor remain in the mouth so long as that of onion. Many persons like shallots for flavoring stews, soups, salads, and pickles. 45. LEEKS.--Another member of the onion family that is more highly prized and more extensively raised in Europe than in the United States is leeks. As Fig. 10 shows, leeks do not produce a bulb as do onions. In this vegetable, the lower parts of the leaves grow close together and form a bulb-like stem, or neck, which is fairly solid and which constitutes the edible part. The odor and flavor of leeks are similar to those of onions, but they are somewhat weaker. The fleshy stem may be bleached by banking it with earth, and when this is done, the flavor becomes more mild and the texture more tender than in the onion bulb. Like shallots, leeks are used to flavor stews, soups, and similar foods. 46. CHIVES.--The member of the onion family known as chives is a small plant whose roots remain in the ground for many years and produce year after year dense tufts of slender, hollow leaves. These leaves grow to a height of about 6 or 8 inches and resemble the tops of onions except that they are much smaller. Chives, which have a more delicate flavor than onions, are much used for flavoring soup, stews, salads, meats, and other vegetables and as a garnish for salads. When used for any of these purposes, they are cut into tiny pieces. PREPARATION OF ONIONS 47. ONIONS FOR FLAVORING.--When only the flavor of onions is desired in a salad or a cooked dish of some sort, such as a dressing for fowl, hash, or any similar combination of food ingredients, the onion should be added in the form of juice and pulp rather than in pieces. Then it will not be possible to observe the onion when it is mixed with the food nor to come across small pieces of it when the food is eaten. To prepare an onion in this way, peel it, cut off a crosswise slice, and then grate the onion on a grater over a shallow dish. Add the juice and pulp thus obtained to any food that calls for onion as a flavoring. 48. ONIONS FOR THE TABLE.--When onions are to be used as a vegetable for the table, they require cooking, but first of all they must be peeled. This is at best a rather unpleasant task, because the fumes from the strong volatile oil are irritating to both the eyes and the nostrils. However, it may be done more comfortably by keeping the onions immersed in cold water during the peeling. Remove only the dry outside shells, and, if the onions are large, cut them in halves or quarters. However, as the various layers are likely to fall apart when the onion is cut, it is advisable to select medium-sized or small onions, for these may be cooked whole. After the onions have been peeled, they may be cooked in a variety of ways. 49. BOILED ONIONS.--Perhaps the simplest method of cooking onions is to boil them. To allow the strong volatile oil to escape instead of being reabsorbed by the onions, and thus improve the flavor of the onions, the cover should be kept off the vessel while they are cooking. The water in which this vegetable is cooked has not a very agreeable flavor, so no use should be made of it. Peel the desired number of onions and if necessary cut them into halves or quarters. Place them in sufficient boiling water to cover well. Cook in an uncovered vessel until tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork, but not so soft as to fall apart. Then pour off the water, season with more salt, if necessary, and a little pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Serve hot. 50. CREAMED ONIONS.--A cream sauce added to onions makes a very appetizing dish. In fact, most persons prefer creamed onions to any other method of preparation. CREAMED ONIONS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 pt. stewed onions 3 Tb. butter 3 Tb. flour 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1-1/2 c. hot milk Prepare the onions according to the directions given in Art. 49. When they are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork, drain. Melt the butter, and add the flour, salt, pepper, and hot milk. Cook until the sauce thickens, pour over the stewed onions, heat together for a few minutes, and serve. 51. BAKED ONIONS.--If variety in the preparation of onions is desired, baked onions should be tried. Select medium-sized onions, peel them, and then boil them whole in boiling salted water until they are almost tender. Drain off the water, place the onions in a shallow dish, brush with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in a hot oven and bake until brown on one side; then turn them and brown on the other side. Serve hot. [Illustration: FIG. 12] 52. STUFFED ONIONS.--When large onions can be secured, a very appetizing as well as attractive dish can be prepared by stuffing them and then baking them brown. Onions cooked in this way will appear as shown in Fig. 12. STUFFED ONIONS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 large onions 1 c. dried bread crumbs 2 Tb. butter 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 1/2 tsp. celery salt 1/4 c. milk Peel the onions and cook them in boiling salted water until almost tender. Remove from the water and take out the inner portions of the onions, leaving the outside layers in the shape of a cup. Chop the portions of the onions which have been removed and mix with the bread crumbs. Melt the butter, add to it the chopped onion, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and celery salt, and stir all together for a few minutes over the flame. Add the milk, and if the 1/4 cupful is not sufficient to make the stuffing moist, add more. Fill the onion shells with the stuffing, place in a hot oven, and bake until brown. Serve immediately. PARSNIPS AND THEIR PREPARATION 53. Parsnips are an important root vegetable, being closely allied to carrots. They are used to a certain extent during the summer when they are immature, but generally they are allowed to mature so that they may be stored for use as a winter vegetable. Parsnips have an advantage over many vegetables in that they have excellent keeping qualities and are particularly hardy, being able to withstand considerable freezing and thawing when they are left in the ground during the winter. However, as they grow older, they develop a woody texture, as do beets and turnips, and so at the end of the winter require longer cooking than at the beginning. 54. In food value, parsnips are somewhat higher than other root vegetables, containing a large amount of carbohydrate, which occurs in the form of sugar. Although they are wholesome and nourishing, they have a peculiar, sweetish flavor that is due to the volatile oil they contain and is objectionable to some persons. Still, those who are fond of this flavor find that parsnips afford an excellent opportunity to give variety to the diet, for they may be prepared in a number of ways, most of which are similar to the ways in which carrots are cooked. 55. In preparing parsnips for cooking, scrape them, if possible, instead of peeling them, so as not to waste any of the edible material. Then, too, try to obtain medium-sized parsnips, for they will be of much better quality than the larger ones. If uneven sizes must be used, the larger ones should be cut before being cooked, so that they will be similar in size to the smaller ones and therefore cook in the same length of time. 56. MASHED PARSNIPS.--A very simple way in which to prepare parsnips is to mash them. Clean and scrape the desired number of parsnips and put them to cook in sufficient boiling salted water to cover. Cook until tender enough to be pierced with a fork, the length of time required to do this depending entirely on the age of the parsnips. When tender, drain off the water and force the parsnips through a colander or a sieve. Season with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve hot. 57. CREAMED PARSNIPS.--Parsnips are sometimes cut into dice and then served with a cream, sauce. When it is desired to prepare them in this way, the accompanying directions should be carefully followed. CREAMED PARSNIPS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. diced parsnips 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 c. milk Clean and scrape the parsnips and cut them into dice 1/2 inch in size. Put these to cook in sufficient boiling salted water to cover, cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork, and then drain. Melt the butter in a double boiler, and add the flour, salt, and pepper. Stir in the hot milk, and cook until the mixture thickens. Pour this sauce over the parsnips, heat together for a few minutes, and serve. 58. BROWNED PARSNIPS.--Parsnips that are browned and sweetened with sugar seem to meet with greater favor than those prepared by other methods. To prepare them in this way, clean and scrape the desired number of parsnips, and slice them in thick slices, or, if they are small, cut them in halves lengthwise. Put them to cook in boiling salted water and cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork, but are not tender enough to fall to pieces. Melt some fat in a frying pan, and place the slices of cooked parsnips in it. Brown on one side, turn, and then brown on the other. Sprinkle with a little sugar and, if necessary, additional salt. Serve. PEAS AND THEIR PREPARATION 59. In addition to beans and lentils, the class of vegetables called legumes includes PEAS, which, both green and dried, are used for food. In composition, there is a decided difference between the two varieties of peas, the green ones being about equal to green corn in food value, and the dried ones having a food value nearly four times as great. In each case, the food substance in the greatest amount is in the form of carbohydrate. In green peas, this is in the form of sugar, while in dried ones it is changed into starch. Peas also contain protein in the form of legumin, there being three times as much of this substance in dried peas as in green ones. The amount found in green peas is sufficient to be of importance in the diet, but the percentage of this substance is so great in dried peas that they may be used very satisfactorily as a meat substitute. 60. GREEN PEAS.--Numerous varieties of green peas are found on the market. A few of them are cooked in the pods, especially when the peas are very young, and are eaten pods and all, just as are string beans. Most of them, however, are allowed to mature further and only the peas are eaten, the shell being discarded. When green peas are purchased, they are always found in the pods. For the peas to be most satisfactory, the pods should be fresh and green and should appear to be well filled. Flat-looking pods mean that the peas have not matured sufficiently. After being purchased, the peas should not be removed from the pods until they are to be cooked. However, if it is necessary that they stand for any length of time after they are shelled, they should be kept in a cool place in order to prevent them from shriveling. Their cooking is similar to that of any other fresh vegetable; that is, they should be cooked in boiling salted water in a covered vessel until they are tender enough to be easily crushed between the fingers or pierced with a fork. With this preliminary preparation, they may be dressed in any desirable manner. 61. DRIED PEAS.--Dried peas, because of their nature, require a different kind of preparation from green peas. In fact, their cooking is similar to that of dried beans. They require long slow cooking and are improved if they are first parboiled in water to which a pinch of soda has been added. They are not used extensively except in the making of soups or occasionally for a pur\\u00e9e or a souffl\\u00e9, but as they are very high in food value and can be used as a meat substitute, they should have a prominent place in the dietary of most families. Many of the ways in which dried beans and lentils are prepared are fully as applicable in the case of dried peas. 62. GREEN PEAS WITH BUTTER.--When peas are young and tender, no more appetizing way to prepare them can be found than to boil them and then serve them with butter. Select fresh green peas with full pods, wash in cold water, and remove the peas from the shells. Put to cook in enough boiling salted water to cover well, and cook until tender. Pour off all but a small amount of the water, using the part poured off for making soup or sauce. Add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served, and season with additional salt if necessary and a dash of pepper. Serve hot. 63. GREEN PEAS ENGLISH STYLE.--If the flavor of mint is agreeable, green peas prepared English style will undoubtedly find favor. Cook them as for green peas with butter, but, at the time the butter is added, add 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped fresh mint. Season with additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, allow all to simmer together for a few minutes, and serve. [Illustration: FIG. 13] 64. CREAMED PEAS.--A cream sauce adds considerable food value and flavor to green peas. Peas prepared in this way may be served plain, but they can be made very attractive by serving them in croustades, as shown in Fig. 13. As already learned, _croustades_ are cases made from large pieces of bread that are cut any desired shape, hollowed out, and then toasted in a hot oven or on a broiler or fried in deep fat until crisp. CREAMED PEAS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. shelled green peas 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1/2 c. water from peas 1/2 c. milk Cook the peas in boiling salted water until tender, and then drain the water from them, retaining 1/2 cupful for the sauce. Melt the butter, add the flour, salt, and pepper, and stir in the hot liquids. Cook until the flour has thickened and then pour over the peas. Serve hot, either plain or in croustades. 65. PEAS IN TURNIP CUPS.--A somewhat unusual dish can be prepared by making cups out of turnips, filling them with peas, and then pouring a cream sauce over the peas. Besides being attractive, this combination makes a very palatable vegetable dish. Select a sufficient number of medium-sized white turnips. Wash them thoroughly, and then hollow out the inside of each, leaving cup-shaped shells about 1/4 inch thick. Cook these shells in boiling salted water until tender, but not tender enough to break into pieces, and remove from the water. Then, according to the directions given in Art. 60, cook enough green peas to fill the cups. When tender, fill the cups with the peas and over them pour a medium white sauce. Serve hot. 66. PEAS PUR\\u00c9E.--Many persons who cannot eat peas because of the coarse outside skins are able to digest them in the form of a pur\\u00e9e. To prepare them in this way, boil fresh peas in the manner explained in Art. 60. When they are tender, force them through a pur\\u00e9e sieve or a fine-mesh wire sieve. The pulp will pass through the sieve, but the coarse skins will remain. The pur\\u00e9e thus made may be used for soup or in the making of a souffl\\u00e9. 67. PEAS SOUFFL\\u00c9.--Nothing in the way of peas is more appetizing and at the same time more easily digested than peas souffl\\u00e9. This may be baked in a large baking dish, or it may be divided and baked in individual baking dishes. PEAS SOUFFL\\u00c9 (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 Tb. butter 2 Tb. flour 1/2 c. milk 1 c. peas pur\\u00e9e 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 2 eggs Melt the butter, stir in the flour, and add the heated milk. Cook until the mixture thickens and then add the peas pur\\u00e9e, salt, and pepper. Separate the eggs, beat the yolks and add them to the mixture, and then fold in the stiffly beaten whites. Pour into a well-greased baking dish or individual baking dishes, place in a pan of hot water, and bake in a slow oven until set, or for 30 or 40 minutes. Serve at once. PEPPERS AND THEIR PREPARATION 68. PEPPERS are one of the fruit vegetables. Some varieties of them are dried and used as a condiment, that is, to season or give relish to food, but as they are never used as a vegetable, they are not included here. It is the sweet varieties of peppers which are used as vegetables and to which reference is made in these discussions. They are valuable chiefly for two reasons: to flavor various kinds of dishes, such as entr\\u00e9es, salads, etc., and to make a dish more attractive in appearance because of the contrast in color they afford. In food value, they are about equal to the various greens, but as a rule such small quantities of them are eaten that they cannot be regarded as a food. 69. STUFFED PEPPERS.--The usual way of preparing peppers as a vegetable is to stuff them and then bake them, when they will appear as in Fig. 14. The stuffing may be made of various kinds of material, such as pieces of meat, vegetables, cereals, etc., and so affords an excellent way to utilize left-overs of any of these foods. Two recipes for stuffing are here given, and either one may be used with equally good results. [Illustration: FIG. 14] To prepare peppers for stuffing, wash them in cold water and remove the tops by cutting around the peppers a short distance from the stem. Remove the pulp and seeds from the inside, and wash the peppers thoroughly to make sure that no loose seeds remain. Fill with the desired stuffing, place in a shallow pan with a small amount of water, and bake until the peppers are soft enough to be pierced with a fork. The water permits the peppers to steam during the first part of the cooking. Serve hot. STUFFING NO. 1 (Sufficient for Six Peppers) 2 Tb. ham fat 1 small chopped onion 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1-1/2 c. steamed rice 1/2 c. bread crumbs 1/2 c. finely chopped boiled ham Milk Melt the fat in a frying pan, add the onion, salt, and pepper, and heat together for several minutes. Add the rice, bread crumbs, and ham, and moisten with milk until the mixture is of the right consistency. Use to fill the peppers. STUFFING NO. 2 (Sufficient for Six Peppers) 2 Tb. butter 1 onion, chopped 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 2 c. stale bread crumbs 2 Tb. chopped parsley 1 tsp. celery salt Milk Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the chopped onion, salt, and pepper, and heat together. To this add the bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and celery salt, and moisten with enough milk to make the stuffing of the right consistency. Use to stuff peppers. POTATOES AND THEIR PREPARATION WHITE POTATOES 70. WHITE POTATOES, popularly called _Irish potatoes_ because they are a staple food in Ireland, belong to the class of tuber vegetables. They form such an extensive part of the diets of the majority of people that they are generally considered the most important vegetable used by civilized man. They are usually roundish or oblong in shape and have a whitish interior and a darker colored skin. 71. FOOD VALUE OF POTATOES.--In food value, Irish potatoes are comparatively high, being in this respect about two and one-half times as great as an equal weight of cabbage, but not quite twice as great as the various root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, etc. The largest amount of this food value occurs as carbohydrate in the form of starch, there being almost no fat and very little protein in potatoes. The starch granules of potatoes are larger than the starch granules of any of the cereals, the class of foods highest in this food substance, and it is the proper cooking of this starch that makes potatoes dry and mealy. Potatoes also contain a large amount of mineral salts, much of which lies directly under the skin. Therefore, the most economical way in which to prepare potatoes is to cook them with the skins on, for then all of the mineral salts are retained and none of the material is wasted. 72. SELECTION OF POTATOES.--The new potato crop begins to come into the market during the summer, when potatoes are especially appetizing. However, as potatoes can be easily stored and kept very well for a considerable time, they form a large part of the winter food supply. If there is sufficient storage space, it is a wise plan to buy a large enough supply of potatoes in the fall to last for several months and then to store them for the winter. However, when this is done, care should be taken in the selection. In the first place, the outside skin should be smooth and not scaly. Then, if possible, potatoes of medium size should be selected, rather than small ones or large ones. The small ones are not so satisfactory, because of the greater proportion of waste in peeling, while the very large ones are apt to have a hollow space in the center. To judge the quality of potatoes, a few of those to be purchased should be secured and cooked before a large number of them are bought. The soil and climatic conditions affect the quality of potatoes to such an extent that a particular kind of potato which may have been excellent last year may be entirely different in quality this year. A housewife cannot, therefore, be guided entirely by her previous knowledge of a certain kind of potato. 73. CARE OF POTATOES.--Potatoes bought in quantity should be kept in a cool place and should be excluded from the light. Such care will usually prevent them from discoloring and sprouting. In case they should sprout, the sprouts should be removed at once, for the potatoes will deteriorate rapidly with such a growth. If the potatoes freeze, they may be thawed by putting them in cold water. Such potatoes, which are characterized by a peculiar sweetish taste, should be used as soon as possible after being thawed. 74. PREPARATION OF POTATOES.--As has already been explained, the most economical way in which to cook potatoes is with the skins on. However, when it is desired to remove the skins, they should be taken off as thinly as possible. New potatoes may be scraped, but completely matured potatoes that have been out of the ground for some time do not scrape easily and so should be pared thinly. Potatoes lend themselves to various methods of cookery, and this is well, for although this is a food of which most persons do not tire easily, variety in the preparation of a vegetable so commonly used as the Irish potato is very much to be desired. When cooked in the skins, potatoes may be boiled, baked, or steamed. When the skins are removed, potatoes may be cooked in these ways, as well as fried, saut\\u00e9d, scalloped, creamed, etc. 75. BOILED POTATOES.--Without doubt, potatoes are cooked more often by boiling than by any other method, for besides being eaten in this way a great deal, they must first be boiled for many of the more elaborate methods of preparation. If the skins are removed before boiling, the water in which the potatoes are cooked contains a quantity of starch and a great deal of soluble mineral matter that are lost from the potatoes. Use should therefore be made of this liquid, it being very satisfactory for soups, sauces, and the liquid required in bread making. When potatoes are to be boiled, select the desired number of medium-sized potatoes, and wash them in cold water. If desired, remove the peelings with a sharp paring knife, but if the potatoes are to be cooked with the skins on, scrub them thoroughly with a vegetable brush in order to remove all dirt. Put to cook in a sufficient amount of boiling salted water to cover well, and cook until the potatoes are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Usually the kettle in which potatoes are cooked is covered, but if desired they may be cooked in an uncovered vessel. When done, drain the water from the potatoes and serve at once or use for some of the other methods of preparation. [Illustration: FIG. 15] 76. MASHED POTATOES.--If mashed potatoes are prepared properly, they are much relished by the majority of persons. However, to be most satisfactory, they should be cooked long enough not to be lumpy and then, after being mashed and softened with milk, they should be beaten until they are light and creamy. Peel the desired number of potatoes and boil them according to the directions given in Art. 75. When they are tender, remove them from the fire and drain off the water. Mash the potatoes with a wooden or a wire potato masher, being careful to reduce all the particles to a pulpy mass in order to prevent lumps. However, the preferable way to mash them is to force them through a ricer, when they will appear as shown in Fig. 15, for then, if they are thoroughly cooked, there will be no danger of lumps. When they are sufficiently mashed, season with additional salt, a dash of pepper, and a small piece of butter, and add hot milk until they are thinned to a mushy consistency, but not too soft to stand up well when dropped from a spoon. Then beat the potatoes vigorously with a large spoon until they become light and fluffy. Serve at once. 77. BAKED POTATOES.--A very nutritious vegetable dish results when potatoes are baked. For this method of cooking potatoes, those of medium size are better than large ones; also, if the potatoes are uniform in size, all of them will bake in the same length of time. It is well to choose for baking, potatoes that are smooth and unblemished, in order that they may be prepared without cutting the skins. As the starchy particles of the potato are cooked by the heated water inside the potato, the cooking cannot be done so successfully when the skin is cut or marred, for then the water will evaporate. Prepare the potatoes by scrubbing them thoroughly; then place them on a shallow pan and set them in the oven or place them directly on the oven grate. The temperature of the oven is important in baking potatoes. If it is too hot, the skins of the potatoes will become charred, and if it is not hot enough, too long a time will be required for the baking. The temperature found to produce the best results is about 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or the same as that for the baking of bread. Turn the potatoes once or twice during the baking, so that they will bake evenly. Allow them to bake until it is possible to pierce them to the center with a fork or they are soft enough to dent easily when pinched with the tips of the fingers. The latter is the preferable test, for when the potato is pierced, so much of the moisture is lost that it is not likely to be of the best quality when served. Upon removing from the oven, serve at once. Baked potatoes become soggy upon standing. If desired, they may be rolled to soften the contents of the shell and then cut open on one side, and pepper, salt, and paprika put into the potato. The length of time required for baking potatoes is usually 10 to 15 minutes longer than is necessary to cook potatoes of the same size in water. However, the time for baking may be decreased by boiling the potatoes for about 5 minutes before they are put in the oven. In such an event, the boiling and the baking should be accomplished in about 35 minutes. 78. STUFFED POTATOES.--An attractive way in which to serve baked potatoes is shown in Fig. 16. After the potatoes are thoroughly baked, the contents are removed, treated as mashed potatoes, and then stuffed into the shells and set in the oven to brown for a few minutes. When something different in the way of potatoes is desired, stuffed potatoes should be tried. Bake the desired number of potatoes until tender. Remove from the oven, cut through the skin of each from end to end with a sharp knife, and scrape out the contents of the shell. Mash the pulp according to the directions given in Art. 76. Then fill the shells with the mashed potatoes, allowing the surface to stand up roughly, as shown, instead of smoothing it down. Dot each with butter, sprinkle a little paprika over the tops, and replace in the oven. Bake until the surface is nicely browned and then serve at once. [Illustration: FIG. 16] 79. BROWNED POTATOES.--While not so easy to digest as boiled or baked potatoes, browned potatoes offer an opportunity for a change from the usual ways of preparing this vegetable. They may be prepared on the stove or in the oven, but when browned in the oven the surface is more likely to be tough. Boil the desired number of potatoes, and when they are sufficiently tender, drain off the water. If they are to be saut\\u00e9d on the stove, melt a small amount of fat in a frying pan, and place the cooked potatoes in it. Saut\\u00e9 until brown on one side, then turn and brown on the other. Season with additional salt, if necessary, and serve. In case it is desired to brown them in the oven, put the boiled potatoes in a shallow pan and brush them over with butter. Set them in a hot oven, allow them to brown on one side, then turn and brown them on the other. Season with salt, if necessary, and serve at once upon removing from the oven. 80. RAW SAUT\\u00c9D POTATOES.--If a potato dish suitable for supper or luncheon is desired, raw potatoes may be sliced thin, as at _a_, Fig. 17, and then saut\\u00e9d. For this purpose, small potatoes that are not suitable for other methods of preparation may be used. Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin slices. Melt a small amount of fat in a frying pan, place the potatoes in the hot fat, and cover the pan. Allow them to steam in this way for 10 to 15 minutes and then remove the cover. Brown on one side; then turn and brown on the other. Season with salt and pepper. [Illustration: FIG. 17] 81. HASH-BROWNED POTATOES.--A very good way in which to use up boiled potatoes is to hash-brown them in the oven. HASH-BROWNED POTATOES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 medium-sized cooked potatoes 1-1/2 tsp. salt 2 Tb. butter 3 Tb. milk 1/4 tsp. pepper Slice or chop the cold potatoes, place in a buttered pan, add the salt and pepper, melt the butter, and pour it over them. Place in a hot oven until nicely browned. Stir, add the milk, and brown again. Stir again, brown the third time, and serve. 82. POTATO PATTIES.--Mashed potatoes, whether left over or boiled and mashed especially for the purpose, may be made up into patties and then saut\\u00e9d until brown on both sides. POTATO PATTIES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. mashed potato 1 egg Fine bread crumbs To the mashed potatoes that have been well seasoned, add the egg and mix thoroughly. Shape into flat, round patties and roll in the bread crumbs. Melt fat in a frying pan, place the patties in it, saut\\u00e9 on one side until brown, and then turn and brown on the other side. Serve hot. 83. FRENCH FRIED POTATOES.--Many families are deprived of French fried potatoes because the majority of housewives think they are difficult to prepare. This, however, is not the case, for when the procedure is understood nothing is easier. Peel the required number of potatoes and cut them into the desired shape. Great variety exists in the method of cutting potatoes for this purpose. However, the form that is usually thought of when French fried potatoes are mentioned is the one obtained by cutting the potatoes into pieces like the sections of an orange and then cutting these sections lengthwise into smaller pieces, like those shown at _b_, Fig. 17. Pieces like those shown at _c_, called _shoestring potatoes_, are also popular. As soon as cut, in no matter what shape, drop the pieces into cold water, but when ready to fry, remove them from the water and dry on a clean dry towel. Place in a wire basket and lower the basket into a pan of hot fat. Fry until the potatoes are nicely browned, remove from the fat, drain, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve at once. 84. POTATOES AU GRATIN.--Something a little unusual in the way of a potato dish is produced when potatoes are combined with cheese, bread crumbs, and a cream sauce to make potatoes au gratin. In addition to supplying flavor, these ingredients increase the food value of the potatoes so that a highly nutritious dish is the result. POTATOES AU GRATIN (Sufficient to Serve Six) 3 c. diced cooked potatoes 1/2 c. grated cheese 1/2 c. bread crumbs 1-1/2 c. thin white sauce Grease a baking dish, place 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the dish, and sprinkle over them 1/2 of the crumbs and then 1/2 of the cheese. Put the remainder of the potatoes in the dish, sprinkle with the rest of the cheese, pour the hot white sauce over all, and place the remaining crumbs on top. Set the dish in a hot oven and bake until well heated through and brown on top. 85. LYONNAISE POTATOES.--When saut\\u00e9d potatoes are flavored with onion and parsley, they are known as Lyonnaise potatoes. As they are very appetizing, potatoes prepared in this way are relished by most persons. LYONNAISE POTATOES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 Tb. butter or ham or bacon fat 1/2 tsp. salt 1 medium-sized onion, chopped Dash of pepper 2 Tb. parsley 3 c. diced cooked potatoes Melt the fat in a frying pan, and add the onion, parsley, salt, and pepper. When the fat is hot, add the potatoes, which should be diced, like those shown at _d_, Fig. 17, and allow them to saut\\u00e9 until slightly brown. Stir frequently to avoid burning. Serve hot. 86. SCALLOPED POTATOES.--Many vegetables may be scalloped, but potatoes seem to lend themselves to this form of preparation to good advantage. Potatoes prepared in this way are suitable for luncheon, supper, or a home dinner. Wash and peel the desired number of potatoes and slice them thin. Place a layer in the bottom of a well-greased baking dish, sprinkle lightly with flour, salt, and pepper, and dot with butter. Add another layer of potatoes, sprinkle again with flour, salt, and pepper, and dot with butter. Continue in this way until the dish is filled. Pour a sufficient quantity of milk over the whole to cover well. Place a cover over the dish, set in a hot oven, and bake for about 1/2 hour. Then remove the cover and allow the potatoes to continue baking until they can be easily pierced with a fork and the surface is slightly brown. Serve hot from the baking dish. 87. CREAMED POTATOES.--A very good way in which to utilize left-over boiled potatoes is to dice them and then serve them with a cream sauce. If no cooked potatoes are on hand and creamed potatoes are desired, potatoes may, of course, be boiled especially for this purpose. When this is done, it is well to cook the potatoes in the skins, for they remain intact better and have a better flavor. Cut up potatoes that are to be creamed into half-inch dice, like those shown at _d_, Fig. 17. Make a thin white sauce, pour it over the potatoes until they are well moistened, and allow the potatoes to simmer in this sauce for a few minutes. If desired, chopped parsley may be added to the sauce to improve the flavor. Serve hot. 88. POTATO BALLS.--If a potato dish is desired for a meal that is to be dainty in every respect, potato balls should be tried. These are small balls of uniform size, like those shown at _e_, Fig. 17, cut from raw potatoes by means of a French cutter, as shown in Fig. 18, cooked until tender, and then dressed with a cream sauce or in any other way. As will be observed, much of the potato remains after all the balls that can be cut from it are obtained. This should not be wasted, but should be boiled and then mashed or prepared in any other desirable way. [Illustration: FIG. 18] Wash and peel the potatoes that are to be used, and then from each potato cut with a French cutter all the balls possible. When a sufficient number have been obtained, boil them until tender in boiling salted water and then drain. Make a thin cream sauce, add the potatoes to this, and heat together thoroughly. Serve hot. 89. POTATO CROQUETTES.--Left-over mashed potatoes can be utilized in no better way than to make croquettes. Of course, if potato croquettes are desired and no potatoes are on hand, it will be necessary to cook potatoes and mash them especially for this purpose. Croquettes made according to the accompanying recipe will be found a delightful addition to the menu. They are often served plain, but are much improved by a medium white sauce or a gravy. POTATO CROQUETTES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. mashed potatoes 2 Tb. chopped parsley 1 Tb. onion juice 1 tsp. celery salt 2 eggs Dry bread crumbs To the mashed potatoes, add the parsley, onion juice, and celery salt and mix thoroughly. Beat the eggs slightly, reserve a small amount to be diluted with water or milk for dipping the croquettes, and add the rest to the potatoes. Shape the mixture into oblong croquettes of uniform size and shape. Roll each in the crumbs, then in the diluted egg, and again in the crumbs. Fry in deep hot fat until an even brown in color. Remove from the fat, drain, and serve. 90. POTATO PUFF.--Mashed potato combined with egg, seasoned well, and baked in the oven makes a very appetizing dish known as potato puff. This is suitable for any meal at which potatoes would be served. POTATO PUFF (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. mashed potato 1/2 tsp. celery salt 1 egg To the mashed potato, add the celery salt. Separate the egg, beat the yolk, and mix it with the potato. Beat the white stiff and fold it into the potato last. Pile into a buttered baking dish, set in a hot oven, and bake until the potato is thoroughly heated through and the surface is brown. Serve at once. SWEET POTATOES 91. SWEET POTATOES are used for practically the same purposes as white potatoes, and while these vegetables resemble each other in many respects they are not related botanically, sweet potatoes being root rather than tuber vegetables. Sweet potatoes are of a tropical nature and have been cultivated for hundreds of years in the West Indies and Central America. They form a staple article of diet in the southern part of the United States, where, on account of the warm climate, they are raised abundantly. They are not raised in the North; still they are consumed there in large quantities. After maturing, sweet potatoes are collected and dried in kilns before shipping. While this makes it possible for them to keep longer than if they were not dried, they do not keep so well as white potatoes and therefore cannot be stored in such large numbers. If they are to be kept for a considerable period of time, they should be wrapped separately in paper and stored in a cool, dry place. 92. Sweet potatoes vary considerably in size, shape, and quality. Some are short and blunt at the tips, others are long and cylindrical, either crooked or straight, while others are medium in size and spindle-shaped. Some varieties, which are known as _yams_, cook moist and sugary, while others, which are simply called sweet potatoes, cook dry and mealy. The kind to select depends entirely on the individual taste, for in composition and food value all the varieties are similar. In composition, sweet potatoes resemble white ones, except that a part of their carbohydrate is in the form of sugar, which gives them their characteristic sweet taste, but in food value they are almost twice as great as white potatoes. 93. The preparation of sweet potatoes is similar to that of white potatoes, for they may be boiled, steamed, baked, mashed, creamed, fried, etc. In fact, they may be used at any time to take the place of white potatoes in the diet. A few recipes are here given for this vegetable, but any of those given under White Potatoes may also be used by merely substituting sweet potatoes for the white potatoes specified. 94. BOILED SWEET POTATOES.--It is a very simple procedure to boil sweet potatoes. When they are to be prepared in this way, select potatoes of uniform size and either remove their skins or cook them with the skins on. If they are not peeled, scrub them perfectly clean. Put them to cook in boiling salted water and allow them to boil until they may be easily pierced with a fork. Drain the water from them, peel if cooked with their skins on, and serve hot with butter or gravy. 95. BAKED SWEET POTATOES.--Persons who are fond of sweet potatoes prefer them baked to any other method of preparation. Select medium-sized potatoes for this purpose, scrub thoroughly, and put in a hot oven to bake. Bake until they are soft enough to dent when pinched between the fingers. Remove from the oven and serve at once. 96. GLAZED SWEET POTATOES.--To increase the sweet taste characteristic of sweet potatoes and favored by many persons, a sweet sirup is sometimes added. When this is done, the potatoes are first boiled and then cut in half lengthwise and saut\\u00e9d. Sweet potatoes so prepared afford a pleasing variety in the diet. Clean and peel the desired number of potatoes and boil them as already explained. Cut them in half lengthwise, so that each piece has a flat side. Melt fat in a frying pan, add the halves of sweet potato, and fry until slightly brown. Then turn and fry on the reverse side. About 10 or 15 minutes before removing from the pan, pour a small quantity of molasses or a mixture of sugar and water over the potatoes, and allow them to cook in this sirup until they are well covered with the sweet substance. Remove from the pan and serve at once. 97. MASHED SWEET POTATOES.--Used alone without further preparation, mashed sweet potatoes make a very palatable dish. However, as in the case of mashed white potatoes, numerous appetizing dishes, such as croquettes, patties, etc., can be made of mashed sweet potatoes, whether left from a previous meal or cooked for this purpose. In the preparation of all such dishes, the recipes given under White Potatoes may be followed. Peel the desired number of potatoes and cook them in boiling salted water until they may be readily pierced with a fork. Drain, force through a sieve or a ricer, and season with salt, pepper, and a small amount of butter. Thin the mixture with sufficient hot milk to make it of a stiff, mush-like consistency. Then beat vigorously until the potato is light and creamy. Serve hot. RADISHES AND THEIR PREPARATION 98. RADISHES are a root vegetable used almost exclusively as a relish or to lend flavor to a vegetable-salad mixture. They are easily and successfully grown and are plentiful and cheap, except when they are out of season and must be raised in hothouses. Numerous varieties of radishes differing from one another in size, shape, and color are raised. The red ones are generally preferred, because they lend color to a dish or a meal, but the white and brown varieties are just as desirable so far as flavor is concerned. 99. Radishes contain very little food value, being about equal to celery and cucumbers in this respect. They do not supply anything valuable to a meal except mineral salts. Although some persons consider radishes difficult to digest, they contain almost nothing that has to be digested, for they are composed largely of cellulose, which does not digest, and water. Radishes disagree with some persons because, like onions and cabbage, they contain a strong volatile oil that gives them their flavor. 100. Since radishes are always eaten raw, they require very little in the way of preparation. The principal thing is to see that they are perfectly clean and as crisp as possible. To make them crisp, allow them to stand in cold water for some time before using them. Then remove the tops and the roots and scrub thoroughly with a vegetable brush. The small red radishes can be made very attractive by cutting the skin in sections to resemble the petals of a rose. When prepared in this way, a small portion of the green top is allowed to remain. SALSIFY AND ITS PREPARATION 101. SALSIFY is a root vegetable resembling in food value such other root vegetables as carrots and parsnips. Because it has a flavor similar to that of oysters, especially when it is used for soup, it has received the name of _vegetable oyster_. It consists of long slender roots that are covered with tiny roots. It is somewhat difficult to clean and prepare, but as it may be stored through the entire winter and is particularly desirable for the making of soup, it is a valuable vegetable. 102. In preparing salsify for cooking, scrape the roots rather than peel them. Then put them in a solution of cold salt water made by using 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water and keep them there until ready to cook them. This precaution will, to a certain extent, prevent the discoloration that always takes place in salsify as soon as the skin is removed. When thus prepared, salsify lends itself to the same forms of preparation as do the other root vegetables. 103. BUTTERED SALSIFY.--The simplest way in which to cook salsify is to cut it in thin slices, boil it until tender, and then serve it with butter. Wash and scrape the desired quantity of salsify and slice in thin slices. Put to cook in boiling salted water, and cook until it can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain off the water, season with pepper and, if necessary, additional salt, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt and serve the salsify hot. 104. CREAMED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--If creamed vegetables are favored, vegetable oysters served with a cream sauce will be very much relished. Clean and scrape the salsify and cut it into 1/4-inch slices. Put to cook in boiling salted water, cook until tender, and then drain. Make a medium white sauce and pour this over the cooked vegetable. Heat together and serve. 105. SCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--A very appetizing scalloped dish can be made of salsify by following the directions given in the accompanying recipe. SCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTERS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 2 c. cooked vegetable oysters 1 c. bread crumbs Salt and pepper 1-1/2 c. thin white sauce Cook the vegetable oysters as explained in Art. 103. Sprinkle a layer of crumbs in the bottom of a well-greased baking dish, place a layer of the cooked vegetable oysters on top of this, and season with salt and pepper. Place a second layer of crumbs and the remainder of the vegetable oysters in the dish, and sprinkle again with salt and pepper. Pour the white sauce over this, and put the remainder of the crumbs on top. Place in a hot oven and bake until well heated through and the top is brown. Serve from the baking dish. SQUASH AND ITS PREPARATION SUMMER SQUASH 106. SUMMER SQUASH is a fruit vegetable belonging to the same class as eggplant, peppers, etc. and occurring in many varieties. The different kinds of this vegetable vary greatly in size, shape, and color, but all of them may be prepared in practically the same way and used for the same purposes. They get their name from the fact that they are grown and used during the summer season; in fact, they must be used at this time, for they do not permit of storage. Summer squash contains a great deal of water, and for this reason its food value is very low, being about equal to that of lettuce, celery, etc. Because of the large percentage of water in its composition, as little water as possible should be added in its cooking, or the result will be a vegetable so watery as to be unattractive and unpalatable. Another precaution that should be taken in its preparation is to remove the seeds and the skins. Many housewives think it unnecessary to do this, for both the skins and the seeds can be eaten after cooking; but most persons prefer to have them removed, as the dish appears more appetizing. _Vegetable marrow_ is a type of summer squash and may be prepared for the table by any of the recipes for summer squash. 107. STEWED SUMMER SQUASH.--The usual way in which to cook summer squash is to stew it. If properly cooked and well seasoned, stewed squash makes a very tasty dish. Wash and peel the desired number of summer squashes, remove the seeds, and cut into small pieces. Put over the flame in just enough water to start the cooking and add sufficient salt to season well. Cook until tender enough to be pierced with a fork and most of the water is boiled away, being careful not to scorch. Remove from the fire, season with pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Mash until the squash is as fine as desired and serve at once. 108. SAUT\\u00c9D SUMMER SQUASH.--For variety, summer squash is sometimes sliced, coated with egg and crumbs, and then saut\\u00e9d until well browned. To prepare it in this way, wash and peel the squash and cut it into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Roll first in beaten egg diluted with milk or water and then in fine crumbs. Saut\\u00e9 in a small amount of fat in a frying pan until well browned, and then turn and brown on the other side. Serve hot. WINTER SQUASH 109. WINTER SQUASH is the kind of squash that may be removed from the vine in the fall and stored for winter use. Although both summer and winter squashes are closely related, they differ considerably in appearance, flavor, texture, and composition. The different varieties of winter squash are usually larger than summer squashes and have a very hard outside covering; also, they contain less water and more carbohydrate and, consequently, have a higher food value. Winter squashes are usually taken from the vines in the fall before the frost sets in, and before they are placed in storage they are allowed to lie in the sunshine for a few days until the skin hardens and becomes flinty. If the outside covering is unmarred when the squashes are stored, they will remain in good condition almost the entire winter season, provided the storage place is cool and dry. 110. To prepare winter squash for cooking, cut it open, remove the seeds, and peel off the outside skin. Because of the hardness of the covering, a cleaver or a hatchet is generally required to open the squash and cut it into pieces. With this done, scrape out the seeds and, with a very sharp large knife, peel off the skin. The squash may then be cooked in any suitable manner. 111. MASHED SQUASH.--If winter squash is desired as a vegetable, it is very often boiled and then mashed. Squash prepared in this way, with the exception of the seasoning, is also used for pie that is similar to pumpkin; in fact, many persons prefer the flavor of squash pie to that of pumpkin pie. Cut pieces of peeled winter squash into cubes about 1 inch in size. Put these to cook in a small amount of boiling water, add enough salt to season, and cook until tender and quite dry. Season the cooked squash with pepper, add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served, and, if desired to increase the sweet taste, add a small amount of sugar. Mash until smooth and serve hot. 112. BAKED SQUASH.--Winter squash, because of its hard covering, is very satisfactory when baked in the shell, as shown in Fig. 19. If it is not desired to cook it in a whole piece, the squash may be cut into pieces about 3 inches square or into triangular pieces. [Illustration: FIG. 19] Remove the seeds from the squash, sprinkle each with salt and pepper, and dot with butter, as shown. Place in a hot oven directly on the grate or in a shallow pan, and bake until the contents of the shells are tender. Remove from the oven, and serve from the shells. If desired, the squash may be scooped from the shells after baking, seasoned at that time instead of when put in the oven, and then served in a vegetable dish. TOMATOES AND THEIR PREPARATION 113. TOMATOES are a fruit vegetable that may be either cooked or prepared raw in many different ways. They are usually red when ripe, and because of this color they are particularly attractive on the table. Green or partly ripe tomatoes are also used in the preparation of many dishes. Tomatoes are composed largely of water, and for this reason their food value is low, being about the same as that of greens. This large proportion of water is also responsible for the fact that they do not keep for a great length of time. Tomatoes, however, have a long season. They begin to appear in the market early in the spring and they may be obtained from this time until the frost kills the vines in the fall. 114. While tomatoes appeal to the majority of persons, they disagree with some on account of the acid they contain. This acid is similar to that found in some fruits, and it is present in greater quantity in cooked tomatoes than in raw ones, the heating of the vegetable apparently increasing the acidity. This acidity of tomatoes may be reduced by the addition of soda, and while soda produces a marked change in the flavor, it is necessary in the preparation of some dishes. For instance, in the case of cream-of-tomato soup, soda must be added to reduce the acidity and thus keep the milk or cream used in preparing this dish from curdling. 115. The skin of tomatoes, whether they are to be eaten raw or cooked, is usually undesirable. Therefore, in preparing tomatoes for the table, the skins are generally removed. In order to do this, first dip the tomatoes into boiling water for several seconds and then immediately into cold water. This will loosen the skins, which may then be peeled off very thinly, and very little of the tomato will be wasted. 116. STEWED TOMATOES.--The usual way of preparing tomatoes is to stew them. Stewed tomatoes may be served plain, but they can be improved very decidedly by toasting cubes of bread and adding these to the tomatoes just before serving. Remove the skins and stem ends from the desired number of tomatoes, and either cut the tomatoes into pieces or allow them to remain whole. Put to cook with little or no water, as the tomatoes themselves usually provide sufficient water. Season with salt, and cook until the tomatoes are reduced to a mushy consistency. Just before removing from the stove, add a dash of pepper and a small amount of butter. 117. SCALLOPED TOMATOES.--A very appetizing way in which to cook tomatoes is to scallop them according to the accompanying recipe. SCALLOPED TOMATOES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 1 c. crumbs, buttered 2 c. stewed tomatoes 1 tsp. salt Dash of pepper 1 Tb. butter Grease a baking dish and place a layer of the crumbs in the bottom. Place a layer of tomatoes over them, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dot with the butter. Add another layer of crumbs and the remainder of the tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and again dot with butter. Place the remainder of the crumbs on top. Bake in a hot oven until well heated through and the crumbs on top are brown. Serve hot from the baking dish. 118. STUFFED TOMATOES.--Tomatoes prove to be very satisfactory when stuffed with a well-seasoned stuffing and then baked. Medium-sized tomatoes that are firm and unblemished should be selected for stuffing. STUFFED TOMATOES (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 tomatoes 1-1/2 c. crumbs 2 Tb. butter 1 small onion, chopped 1 tsp. celery salt 1/2 tsp. salt Dash of pepper Remove the stem end from each tomato and scoop out the inside so that a hollow shell remains. Chop the pulp of the tomatoes into small pieces and add the crumbs, melted butter, onion, celery salt, salt, and pepper. Mix together thoroughly. If the tomatoes do not furnish enough liquid to moisten the crumbs, add a little water. Pack the stuffing into the tomatoes, allowing it to heap up on top, and place the tomatoes side by side in a shallow pan. Set in a hot oven and bake until the tomato shells are tender enough to be pierced with a fork and the stuffing is well heated through. Serve at once. [Illustration: FIG. 20] 119. STUFFED TOMATOES WITH CHEESE CARROTS.--An attractive way in which to serve stuffed tomatoes is shown in Fig. 20. The tomatoes are filled with a tasty stuffing and then baked. Yellow cream cheese is made to resemble tiny carrots, and these, together with parsley, are used to garnish the platter in which the tomatoes are placed. STUFFED TOMATOES WITH CHEESE CARROTS (Sufficient to Serve Six) 6 medium-sized tomatoes 4 Tb. bacon or ham fat 2 Tb. chopped onion 1/2 c. chopped ham 1-1/2 c. stale bread crumbs 1/2 tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper 2 Tb. chopped parsley Yellow cream cheese Parsley Cut the tops from the tomatoes and remove the pulp. Melt the fat in a frying pan, add the chopped onion, ham, tomato pulp, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley. Heat thoroughly and mix well. Fill the tomatoes with the stuffing, which should be quite moist, put them in a shallow pan, and bake them until the tomato shell may be easily pierced with a fork. Mash yellow cream cheese and, if necessary, moisten it slightly with cream. Shape it into tiny carrots with the fingers, and put a piece of parsley in one end for leaves. Place the baked tomatoes on a platter and garnish with the carrots and sprigs of parsley. Serve. 120. SAUT\\u00c9D TOMATOES.--Half ripened tomatoes are delicious when saut\\u00e9d. Cut the desired number of such tomatoes into slices about 1/4 inch thick, and roll first in beaten egg and then in stale bread crumbs or cracker crumbs. Saut\\u00e9 in a small amount of fat until they are brown on one side; then turn and brown on the other side. Remove from the pan and serve at once. 121. CREAMED TOMATOES.--A rather unusual, but nevertheless very appetizing, way of preparing tomatoes consists in saut\\u00e9ing them in fat and then serving them with a cream sauce on freshly toasted bread. When it is desired to prepare tomatoes in this manner, select medium-sized ones and cut them into slices 1/2 inch thick. Roll the slices first in egg and then in stale bread crumbs or cracker crumbs. Saut\\u00e9 in a generous amount of fat until brown, drain carefully, and brown on the other side. When done, remove from the pan. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour to the fat that remains in the pan, and stir until the flour becomes light brown. Add 1-1/2 cupfuls of milk and stir until thick. Place the slices of tomato on freshly toasted bread and pour the sauce over them. TURNIPS AND THEIR PREPARATION 122. TURNIPS, which are a root vegetable, occur in two varieties, _white_ and _yellow_. The white ones are commonly known as _turnips_ and the yellow ones are called _rutabagas_. Although differing in color, both varieties have much the same flavor and may be prepared in the same ways. Therefore, whenever a recipe calls for turnips, rutabagas may be used as well. 123. In food value, turnips are similar to beets, carrots, and parsnips. They have a strong flavor, which is disliked by many persons and disagrees with some. However, much of this can be dissipated by cooking them with the cover of the kettle removed, so that when properly prepared they furnish a pleasant variety to the winter menu. They have good storing qualities and can be kept very easily through the winter. Toward spring it is more difficult to cook them soft, as the cellulose in them becomes harder and they are likely to develop woody fiber. 124. In preparing turnips for cooking, scrub them until thoroughly clean and then peel, wasting no more of the vegetable than is necessary. They may then be cut up as desired for the recipe to be prepared. 125. STEWED TURNIPS.--When turnips are stewed until tender and then seasoned with salt and pepper and flavored with butter they form a very palatable dish. To prepare them in this way, select the desired number, scrub them until clean, and then peel them. Cut them into dice about 1/2 inch in size, and put these to cook in boiling salted water, allowing the cover to remain off the kettle during the cooking. Cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork and drain the water from them. Season with additional salt, if necessary, and with pepper, and add 1 tablespoonful of butter for each four persons to be served. Allow the butter to melt and serve hot. 126. MASHED TURNIPS.--Turnips, like potatoes, are a very good vegetable to mash. Prepare the desired number in the manner explained in Art. 125. Cook in boiling salted water with the kettle cover removed. When tender enough to be mashed easily, drain the water from them, mash with a potato masher, and season with additional salt if necessary and with pepper and butter. Allow the butter to melt and serve hot. 127. CREAMED TURNIPS.--Turnips, both yellow and white, make an excellent dish when dressed with a cream sauce. Prepare the desired number of turnips by cleaning and peeling them and cutting them into dice about 1/2 inch in size. Cook until tender in boiling salted water and drain. Prepare a medium white sauce and pour over the turnips. Serve hot. VEGETABLE COMBINATIONS 128. The recipes given for the various kinds of vegetables pertain in most cases to merely one vegetable, and this is the way in which this food is usually prepared. However, there are times when it is an advantage to combine two or more vegetables. For instance, it is sometimes desired to give additional variety to the menu or to utilize small quantities of vegetable that alone would not be sufficient to serve the family. Then, again, two vegetables are often prepared together in order to obtain an attractive color combination. In view of these facts, several recipes for the most usual combinations of vegetables are here given, so that the housewife may not be at a loss when she wishes to combine two or more vegetables. It must not be thought that these are the only combinations that can be prepared, for often vegetables can be combined to suit the housewife's taste and needs. 129. CARROTS AND PEAS.--If an attractive combination, as well as an appetizing dish, is desired, carrots and peas should be prepared together and served with butter or a vegetable or a cream sauce. This combination may be served plain, but if there are any mashed potatoes on hand and an attractive dish is desired, it may be served in potato rosettes, as shown in Fig. 21. Clean and scrape the desired number of young, tender carrots, and cut them into dice about the size of the peas that are to be used. Shell an equal quantity of green peas. Put the two vegetables together in boiling salted water and cook until tender. If there is any possibility that the carrots will not cook in as short a period of time as the peas, cook them for some time before adding the peas. When tender, pour off the water, add additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, and dress with butter or, if preferred, with a vegetable or a white sauce. Heat through thoroughly and serve. [Illustration: FIG. 21] If it is desired to serve the carrots and peas in the rosettes mentioned, force hot mashed potato through a pastry tube and form the required number of rosettes on a platter, as shown. In the center of each rosette put a spoonful or two of the carrots and peas. In case fresh peas cannot be secured, canned peas may be substituted. When this is done, the carrots should be cooked until tender and the peas added just before the sauce is poured over the vegetables. 130. SUCCOTASH.--A combination of fresh shelled beans and sweet corn is known as succotash. To prepare this dish, shell the beans and put them to cook in boiling salted water. Cook until they are tender and the water has boiled down until it is greatly reduced in quantity. Then cut an equal amount of corn from the cob and add to the beans. Cook for a few minutes longer or until the water is sufficiently reduced, so that the combination may be served without pouring any water off. Dress with butter and season with pepper and, if necessary, additional salt. During the winter, when green corn and fresh beans cannot be secured, succotash can be made by using dried or canned corn and dried beans. 131. CORN AND TOMATOES.--A somewhat unusual vegetable combination is made by cooking tomatoes and green corn together. Prepare the desired number of tomatoes in the usual way for stewing and cut an equal amount of sweet corn from the cob. Put the two vegetables together in a saucepan and cook until the tomatoes are well stewed. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar, if desired, and add a small piece of butter. Serve hot. 132. CORN, STRING BEANS, AND TOMATOES.--Those who care for the combination of corn and tomatoes will find beans a very agreeable addition to this dish. Prepare the corn and tomatoes as explained in Art. 131, and to them add young, tender string beans that have been previously cooked in boiling salted water. Add the desired seasoning and a small amount of butter. When thoroughly heated, serve. 133. PEAS AND POTATOES.--As a rule, the first green peas and the first new potatoes come into the market at about the same time. If a delicious combination is desired, these two vegetables should be cooked together and then dressed in any desirable way. Select small potatoes, scrape them, and put them to cook in boiling salted water. Shell an equal amount of green peas, and add them to the potatoes about 20 minutes before the potatoes become tender. Cook until both vegetables are tender, and then drain the water from them. Dress with butter, vegetable sauce, cream sauce, or thin cream and serve. 134. TURNIPS AND POTATOES.--Persons who are likely to find the flavor of turnips disagreeable can usually eat them when they are combined with potatoes. Pare an equal number of Irish potatoes and turnips and cut them into thick slices. Put them to cook in boiling salted water and cook with the cover off the kettle until both are tender. Drain and dress with butter or add butter and mash together. Serve hot. 135. NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER.--A combination of food that is much used by the people of the New England States and has become famous throughout the United States, consists of corned beef, potatoes, turnips, and cabbage. As may well be imagined, such a combination forms practically all that is necessary for a home dinner. Select a good piece of corned beef and put it to cook in boiling water. About 30 minutes before the beef has finished cooking, add additional water, if necessary, and into this place an equal quantity of Irish potatoes, turnips, and cabbage prepared in the required way and cut into thick slices or chunks. Cook until the vegetables are tender. Then remove the beef to a platter, surround with vegetables, and serve. SERVING VEGETABLES 136. The way in which vegetables are served depends largely on the method of preparation. However, a point that should never be neglected, so far as cooked vegetables are concerned, no matter what plan of serving is followed, is to see that they are always served hot. To make this possible, the dishes in which they are served should be heated before the vegetables are put into them and should be kept hot until put on the table. When a vegetable dish has a cover, the cover should be kept on until the vegetable is served and should be replaced after the first serving, so as to keep the remainder hot. 137. Because of the possible variety in the preparation of this class of foods, numerous ways of serving them are in practice. When a vegetable is baked in a large baking dish, the dish should be placed on the table and the vegetable served from it either on the plate or in individual dishes. If individual baking dishes are used, these should be set on small plates and one put at each person's place. Boiled or creamed vegetables may be served at the table from a vegetable dish, being put on the plate or in small dishes, or they may be served in individual dishes in the kitchen, and a dish placed at the left of each person's place. When the large dish or the baking dish is placed on the table, it should be placed where the vegetable may be conveniently served by the host if it is to be put on the dinner plate or by the hostess in case it is to be served in individual dishes at the table. 138. In addition to being served in these ways, vegetables also lend themselves to various attractive methods of serving. For instance, a vegetable prepared with a sauce is frequently served in patty shells, timbale cases, or croustades. When this is done, the case in which the vegetable is served is, as a rule, placed directly on the dinner plate. Potatoes that have been mashed are often forced through a pastry tube either to garnish another dish or to make a dish of potatoes more attractive. For instance, when mashed potatoes are to be served, a solid foundation of the potato may be arranged in the center of a dish and a little of the mashed potato then forced through the tube to make a design over the top. Before being served, the dish should be placed in the oven and the potato browned on top. A little thought on the part of the housewife will enable her to work out many other attractive methods in the serving of this food.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\\u2122 Project Gutenberg\\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3.

The Foundation\\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg\\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\u2122 electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. \",\n          \"\\ufeffThe Project Gutenberg eBook of There's Pippins and Cheese to Come This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

A Plague of All Cowards XI. The Asperities of the Early British Reviewers XII. The Pursuit of Fire THERE'S PIPPINS AND CHEESE TO COME There's Pippins and Cheese To Come In my noonday quest for food, if the day is fine, it is my habit to shun the nearer places of refreshment. I take the air and stretch myself. Like Eve's serpent I go upright for a bit. Yet if time presses, there may be had next door a not unsavory stowage. A drinking bar is nearest to the street where its polished brasses catch the eye. It holds a gilded mirror to such red-faced nature as consorts within. Yet you pass the bar and come upon a range of tables at the rear. Now, if you yield to the habits of the place you order a rump of meat. Gravy lies about it like a moat around a castle, and if there is in you the zest for encounter, you attack it above these murky waters. \\\"This castle hath a pleasant seat,\\\" you cry, and charge upon it with pike advanced. But if your appetite is one to peck and mince, the whiffs that breathe upon the place come unwelcome to your nostrils. In no wise are they like the sweet South upon your senses. There is even a suspicion in you--such is your distemper--that it is too much a witch's cauldron in the kitchen, \\\"eye of newt, and toe of frog,\\\" and you spy and poke upon your food. Bus boys bear off the crockery as though they were apprenticed to a juggler and were only at the beginning of their art. Waiters bawl strange messages to the cook. It's a tongue unguessed by learning, yet sharp and potent. Also, there comes a riot from the kitchen, and steam issues from the door as though the devil himself were a partner and conducted here an upper branch. Like the man in the old comedy, your belly may still ring dinner, but the tinkle is faint. Such being your state, you choose a daintier place to eat. Having now set upon a longer journey--the day being fine and the sidewalks thronged--you pass by a restaurant that is but a few doors up the street. A fellow in a white coat flops pancakes in the window. But even though the pancake does a double somersault and there are twenty curious noses pressed against the glass, still you keep your course uptown. Nor are you led off because a near-by stairway beckons you to a Chinese restaurant up above. A golden dragon swings over the door. Its race has fallen since its fire-breathing grandsire guarded the fruits of the Hesperides. Are not \\\"soys\\\" and \\\"chou meins\\\" and other such treasures of the East laid out above? And yet the dragon dozes at its post like a sleepy dog. No flame leaps up its gullet. The swish of its tail is stilled. If it wag at all, it's but in friendship or because a gust of wind has stirred it from its dreams. I have wondered why Chinese restaurants are generally on the second story. A casual inquiry attests it. I know of one, it is true, on the ground level, yet here I suspect a special economy. The place had formerly been a German restaurant, with Teuton scrolls, \\\"Ich Dien,\\\" and heraldries on its walls. A frugal brush changed the decoration. From the heart of a Prussian blazonry, there flares on you in Chinese yellow a recommendation to try \\\"Our Chicken Chop Soy.\\\" The quartering of the House of Hohenzollern wears a baldric in praise of \\\"Subgum Noodle Warmein,\\\" which it seems they cook to an unusual delicacy. Even a wall painting of Rip Van Winkle bowling at tenpins in the mountains is now set off with a pigtail. But the chairs were Dutch and remain as such. Generally, however, Chinese restaurants are on the second story. Probably there is a ritual from the ancient days of Ming Ti that Chinamen when they eat shall sit as near as possible to the sacred moon. But hold a bit! In your haste up town to find a place to eat, you are missing some of the finer sights upon the way. In these windows that you pass, the merchants have set their choicest wares. If there is any commodity of softer gloss than common, or one shinier to the eye--so that your poverty frets you--it is displayed here. In the window of the haberdasher, shirts--mere torsos with not a leg below or head above--yet disport themselves in gay neckwear. Despite their dismemberment they are tricked to the latest turn of fashion. Can vanity survive such general amputation? Then there is hope for immortality. But by what sad chance have these blithe fellows been disjointed? If a gloomy mood prevails in you--as might come from a bad turn of the market--you fancy that the evil daughter of Herodias still lives around the corner, and that she has set out her victims to the general view. If there comes a hurdy-gurdy on the street and you cock your ear to the tune of it, you may still hear the dancing measure of her wicked feet. Or it is possible that these are the kindred of Holofernes and that they have supped guiltily in their tents with a sisterhood of Judiths. Or we may conceive--our thoughts running now to food--that these gamesome creatures of the haberdasher had dressed themselves for a more recent banquet. Their black-tailed coats and glossy shirts attest a rare occasion. It was in holiday mood, when they were fresh-combed and perked in their best, that they were cut off from life. It would appear that Jack Ketch the headsman got them when they were rubbed and shining for the feast. We'll not squint upon his writ. It is enough that they were apprehended for some rascality. When he came thumping on his dreadful summons, here they were already set, fopped from shoes to head in the newest whim. Spoon in hand and bib across their knees--lest they fleck their careful fronts--they waited for the anchovy to come. And on a sudden they were cut off from life, unfit, unseasoned for the passage. Like the elder Hamlet's brother, they were engaged upon an act that had no relish of salvation in it. You may remember the lamentable child somewhere in Dickens, who because of an abrupt and distressing accident, had a sandwich in its hand but no mouth to put it in. Or perhaps you recall the cook of the Nancy Bell and his grievous end. The poor fellow was stewed in his own stew-pot. It was the Elderly Naval Man, you recall--the two of them being the ship's sole survivors on the deserted island, and both of them lean with hunger--it was the Elderly Naval Man (the villain of the piece) who \\\"ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals in the scum of the boiling broth.\\\" And yet by looking on these torsos of the haberdasher, one is not brought to thoughts of sad mortality. Their joy is so exultant. And all the things that they hold dear--canes, gloves, silk hats, and the newer garments on which fashion makes its twaddle--are within reach of their armless sleeves. Had they fingers they would be smoothing themselves before the glass. Their unbodied heads, wherever they may be, are still smiling on the world, despite their divorcement. Their tongues are still ready with a jest, their lips still parted for the anchovy to come. A few days since, as I was thinking--for so I am pleased to call my muddy stirrings--what manner of essay I might write and how best to sort and lay out the rummage, it happened pat to my needs that I received from a friend a book entitled \\\"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened.\\\" Now, before it came I had got so far as to select a title. Indeed, I had written the title on seven different sheets of paper, each time in the hope that by the run of the words I might leap upon some further thought. Seven times I failed and in the end the sheets went into the waste basket, possibly to the confusion of Annie our cook, who may have mistaken them for a reiterated admonishment towards the governance of her kitchen--at the least, a hint of my desires and appetite for cheese and pippins. \\\"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Opened\\\" is a cook book. It is due you to know this at once, otherwise your thoughts--if your nature be vagrant--would drift towards family skeletons. Or maybe the domestic traits prevail and you would think of dress-clothes hanging in camphorated bags and a row of winter boots upon a shelf. I am disqualified to pass upon the merits of a cook book, for the reason that I have little discrimination in food. It is not that I am totally indifferent to what lies on the platter. Indeed, I have more than a tribal aversion to pork in general, while, on the other hand, I quicken joyfully when noodles are interspersed with bacon. I have a tooth for sweets, too, although I hold it unmanly and deny it as I can. I am told also--although I resent it--that my eye lights up on the appearance of a tray of French pastry. I admit gladly, however, my love of onions, whether they come hissing from the skillet, or lie in their first tender whiteness. They are at their best when they are placed on bread and are eaten largely at midnight after society has done its worst. A fine dinner is lost within me. A quail is but an inferior chicken--a poor relation outside the exclusive hennery. Terrapin sits low in my regard, even though it has wallowed in the most aristocratic marsh. Through such dinners I hack and saw my way without even gaining a memory of my progress. If asked the courses, I balk after the recital of the soup. Indeed, I am so forgetful of food, even when I dine at home, that I can well believe that Adam when he was questioned about the apple was in real confusion. He had or he had not. It was mixed with the pomegranate or the quince that Eve had sliced and cooked on the day before. A dinner at its best is brought to a single focus. There is one dish to dominate the cloth, a single bulk to which all other dishes are subordinate. If there be turkey, it should mount from a central platter. Its protruding legs out-top the candles. All other foods are, as it were, privates in Caesar's army. They do no more than flank the pageant. Nor may the pantry hold too many secrets. Within reason, everything should be set out at once, or at least a gossip of its coming should run before. Otherwise, if the stew is savory, how shall one reserve a corner for the custard? One must partition himself justly--else, by an over-stowage at the end, he list and sink. I am partial to picnics--the spreading of the cloth in the woods or beside a stream--although I am not avid for sandwiches unless hunger press me. Rather, let there be a skillet in the company and let a fire be started! Nor need a picnic consume the day. In summer it requires but the late afternoon, with such borrowing of the night as is necessary for the journey home. You leave the street car, clanking with your bundles like an itinerant tinman. You follow a stream, which on these lower stretches, it is sad to say, is already infected with the vices of the city. Like many a countryman who has come to town, it has fallen to dissipation. It shows the marks of the bottle. Further up, its course is cleaner. You cross it in the mud. Was it not Christian who fell into the bog because of the burden on his back? Then you climb a villainously long hill and pop out upon an open platform above the city. The height commands a prospect to the west. Below is the smoke of a thousand suppers. Up from the city there comes the hum of life, now somewhat fallen with the traffic of the day--as though Nature already practiced the tune for sending her creatures off to sleep. You light a fire. The baskets disgorge their secrets. Ants and other leviathans think evidently that a circus has come or that bears are in the town. The chops and bacon achieve their appointed destiny. You throw the last bone across your shoulder. It slips and rattles to the river. The sun sets. Night like an ancient dame puts on her jewels: And now that I have climbed and won this height, I must tread downward through the sloping shade And travel the bewildered tracks till night. Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed And see the gold air and the silver fade And the last bird fly into the last light. By these confessions you will see how unfit I am to comment on the old cook book of Sir Kenelm Digby. Yet it lies before me. It may have escaped your memory in the din of other things, that in the time when Oliver Cromwell still walked the earth, there lived in England a man by the name of Kenelm Digby, who was renowned in astrology and alchemy, piracy, wit, philosophy and fashion. It appears that wherever learning wagged its bulbous head, Sir Kenelm was of the company. It appears, also, that wherever the mahogany did most groan, wherever the possets were spiced most delicately to the nose, there too did Sir Kenelm bib and tuck himself. With profundity, as though he sucked wisdom from its lowest depth, he spouted forth on the transmutation of the baser metals or tossed you a phrase from Paracelsus. Or with long instructive finger he dissertated on the celestial universe. One would have thought that he had stood by on the making of it and that his judgment had prevailed in the larger problems. Yet he did not neglect his trencher. And now as time went on, the richness of the food did somewhat dominate his person. The girth of his wisdom grew no less, but his body fattened. In a word, the good gentleman's palate came to vie with his intellect. Less often was he engaged upon some dark saying of Isidore of Seville. Rather, even if his favorite topic astrology were uppermost about the table, his eye travelled to the pantry on every change of dishes. His fingers, too, came to curl most delicately on his fork. He used it like an epicure, poking his viands apart for sharpest scrutiny. His nod upon a compote was much esteemed. Now mark his further decline! On an occasion--surely the old rascal's head is turned!--he would be found in private talk with his hostess, the Lady of Middlesex, or with the Countess of Monmouth, not as you might expect, on the properties of fire or on the mortal diseases of man, but--on subjects quite removed. Society, we may be sure, began to whisper of these snug parleys in the arbor after dinner, these shadowed mumblings on the balcony when the moon was up--and Lady Digby stiffened into watchfulness. It was when they took leave that she saw the Countess slip a note into her lord's fingers. Her jealousy broke out. \\\"Viper!\\\" She spat the words and seized her husband's wrist. Of course the note was read. It proved, however, that Sir Kenelm was innocent of all mischief. To the disappointment of the gossips, who were tuned to a spicier anticipation, the note was no more than a recipe of the manner that the Countess was used to mix her syllabub, with instruction that it was the \\\"rosemary a little bruised and the limon-peal that did quicken the taste.\\\" Advice, also, followed in the postscript on the making of tea, with counsel that \\\"the boiling water should remain upon it just so long as one might say a _miserere_.\\\" A mutual innocence being now established, the Lady Digby did by way of apology peck the Countess on the cheek. Sir Kenelm died in 1665, full of years. In that day his fame rested chiefly on his books in physic and chirurgery. His most enduring work was still to be published--\\\"The Closet Opened.\\\" It was two years after his death that his son came upon a bundle of his father's papers that had hitherto been overlooked. I fancy that he went spying in the attic on a rainy day. In the darkest corner, behind the rocking horse--if such devices were known in those distant days--he came upon a trunk of his father's papers. \\\"Od's fish,\\\" said Sir Kenelm's son, \\\"here's a box of manuscripts. It is like that they pertain to alchemy or chirurgery.\\\" He pulled out a bundle and held it to the light--such light as came through the cobwebs of the ancient windows. \\\"Here be strange matters,\\\" he exclaimed. Then he read aloud: \\\"My Lord of Bristol's Scotch collops are thus made: Take a leg of fine sweet mutton, that to make it tender, is kept as long as possible may be without stinking. In winter seven or eight days\\\"--\\\"Ho! Ho!\\\" cried Sir Kenelm's son. \\\"This is not alchemy!\\\" He drew out another parchment and read again: \\\"My Lord of Carlile's sack posset, how it's made: Take a pottle of cream and boil in it a little whole cinnamon and three or four flakes of mace. Boil it until it simpreth and bubbleth.\\\" By this time, as you may well imagine, Sir Kenelm's son was wrought to an excitement. It is likely that he inherited his father's palate and that the juices of his appetite were stirred. Seizing an armful of the papers, he leaped down the attic steps, three at a time. His lady mother thrust a curled and papered head from her door and asked whether the chimney were afire, but he did not heed her. The cook was waddling in her pattens. He cried to her to throw wood upon the fire. That night the Digby household was served a delicacy, red herrings broiled in the fashion of my Lord d'Aubigny, \\\"short and crisp and laid upon a sallet.\\\" Also, there was a wheaten flommery as it was made in the West Country--for the cook chose quite at random--and a slip-coat cheese as Master Phillips proportioned it. Also, against the colic, which was ravishing the country, the cook prepared a metheglin as Lady Stuart mixed it--\\\"nettles, fennel and grumel seeds, of each two ounces being small-cut and mixed with honey and boiled together.\\\" It is on record that the Lady Digby smiled for the first time since her lord had died, and when the grinning cook bore in the platter, she beat upon the table with her spoon. The following morning, Sir Kenelm's son posted to London bearing the recipes, with a pistol in the pocket of his great coat against the crossing of Hounslow Heath. He went to a printer at the Star in Little Britain whose name was H. Brome. Shortly the book appeared. It was the son who wrote the preface: \\\"There needs no Rhetoricating Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well known, having been a Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite Curiosity in his Researches. Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie Knight, Fellow of the Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother, (Et omen in Nomine) His name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work.\\\" The sale of the book is not recorded. It is supposed that the Lady Middlesex, so many of whose recipes had been used, directed that her chair be carried to the shop where the book was for sale and that she bought largely of it. The Countess of Dorset bought a copy and spelled it out word for word to her cook. As for the Lady Monmouth, she bought not a single copy, which neglect on coming to the Digbys aroused a coolness. To this day it is likely that a last auspicated volume still sits on its shelf with the spice jars in some English country kitchen and that a worn and toothless cook still thumbs its leaves. If the guests about the table be of an antique mind, still will they pledge one another with its honeyed drinks, still will they pipe and whistle of its virtues, still will they-- \\\"EAT\\\"--A flaring sign hangs above the sidewalk. By this time, in our noonday search for food, we have come into the thick of the restaurants. In the jungle of the city, here is the feeding place. Here come the growling bipeds for such bones and messes as are thrown them. The waiter thrusts a card beneath my nose. \\\"Nice leg of lamb, sir?\\\" I waved him off. \\\"Hold a bit!\\\" I cried. \\\"You'll fetch me a capon in white broth as my Lady Monmouth broileth hers. Put plentiful sack in it and boil it until it simpreth!\\\" The waiter scratched his head. \\\"The chicken pie is good,\\\" he said. \\\"It's our Wednesday dish.\\\" \\\"Varlet!\\\" I cried--then softened. \\\"Let it be the chicken pie! But if the cook knoweth the manner that Lord Carlile does mix and pepper it, let that manner be followed to the smallest fraction of a pinch!\\\" On Buying Old Books By some slim chance, reader, you may be the kind of person who, on a visit to a strange city, makes for a bookshop. Of course your slight temporal business may detain you in the earlier hours of the day. You sit with committees and stroke your profound chin, or you spend your talent in the market, or run to and fro and wag your tongue in persuasion. Or, if you be on a holiday, you strain yourself on the sights of the city, against being caught in an omission. The bolder features of a cathedral must be grasped to satisfy a quizzing neighbor lest he shame you later on your hearth, a building must be stuffed inside your memory, or your pilgrim feet must wear the pavement of an ancient shrine. However, these duties being done and the afternoon having not yet declined, do you not seek a bookshop to regale yourself? Doubtless, we have met. As you have scrunched against the shelf not to block the passage, but with your head thrown back to see the titles up above, you have noticed at the corner of your eye--unless it was one of your blinder moments when you were fixed wholly on the shelf--a man in a slightly faded overcoat of mixed black and white, a man just past the nimbleness of youth, whose head is plucked of its full commodity of hair. It was myself. I admit the portrait, though modesty has curbed me short of justice. Doubtless, we have met. It was your umbrella--which you held villainously beneath your arm--that took me in the ribs when you lighted on a set of Fuller's Worthies. You recall my sour looks, but it was because I had myself lingered on the volumes but cooled at the price. How you smoothed and fingered them! With what triumph you bore them off! I bid you--for I see you in a slippered state, eased and unbuttoned after dinner--I bid you turn the pages with a slow thumb, not to miss the slightest tang of their humor. You will of course go first, because of its broad fame, to the page on Shakespeare and Ben Jonson and their wet-combats at the Mermaid. But before the night is too far gone and while yet you can hold yourself from nodding, you will please read about Captain John Smith of Virginia and his \\\"strange performances, the scene whereof is laid at such a distance, they are cheaper credited than confuted.\\\" In no proper sense am I a buyer of old books. I admit a bookish quirk maybe, a love of the shelf, a weakness for morocco, especially if it is stained with age. I will, indeed, shirk a wedding for a bookshop. I'll go in \\\"just to look about a bit, to see what the fellow has,\\\" and on an occasion I pick up a volume. But I am innocent of first editions. It is a stiff courtesy, as becomes a democrat, that I bestow on this form of primogeniture. Of course, I have nosed my way with pleasure along aristocratic shelves and flipped out volumes here and there to ask their price, but for the greater part, it is the plainer shops that engage me. If a rack of books is offered cheap before the door, with a fixed price upon a card, I come at a trot. And if a brown dust lies on them, I bow and sniff upon the rack, as though the past like an ancient fop in peruke and buckle were giving me the courtesy of its snuff box. If I take the dust in my nostrils and chance to sneeze, it is the fit and intended observance toward the manners of a former century. I have in mind such a bookshop in Bath, England. It presents to the street no more than a decent front, but opens up behind like a swollen bottle. There are twenty rooms at least, piled together with such confusion of black passages and winding steps, that one might think that the owner himself must hold a thread when he visits the remoter rooms. Indeed, such are the obscurities and dim turnings of the place, that, were the legend of the Minotaur but English, you might fancy that the creature still lived in this labyrinth, to nip you between his toothless gums--for the beast grows old--at some darker corner. There is a story of the place, that once a raw clerk having been sent to rummage in the basement, his candle tipped off the shelf. He was left in so complete darkness that his fears overcame his judgment and for two hours he roamed and babbled among the barrels. Nor was his absence discovered until the end of the day when, as was the custom, the clerks counted noses at the door. When they found him, he bolted up the steps, nor did he cease his whimper until he had reached the comforting twilight of the outer world. He served thereafter in the shop a full two years and had a beard coming--so the story runs--before he would again venture beyond the third turning of the passage; to the stunting of his scholarship, for the deeper books lay in the farther windings. Or it may appear credible that in ages past a jealous builder contrived the place. Having no learning himself and being at odds with those of better opportunity, he twisted the pattern of the house. Such was his evil temper, that he set the steps at a dangerous hazard in the dark, in order that scholars--whose eyes are bleared at best--might risk their legs to the end of time. Those of strict orthodoxy have even suspected the builder to have been an atheist, for they have observed what double joints and steps and turnings confuse the passage to the devouter books--the Early Fathers in particular being up a winding stair where even the soberest reader might break his neck. Be these things as they may, leather bindings in sets of \\\"grenadier uniformity\\\" ornament the upper and lighter rooms. Biography straggles down a hallway, with a candle needed at the farther end. A room of dingy plays--Wycherley, Congreve and their crew--looks out through an area grating. It was through even so foul an eye, that when alive, they looked upon the world. As for theology, except for the before-mentioned Fathers, it sits in general and dusty convention on the landing to the basement, its snuffy sermons, by a sad misplacement--or is there an ironical intention?--pointing the way to the eternal abyss below. It was in this shop that I inquired whether there was published a book on piracy in Cornwall. Now, I had lately come from Tintagel on the Cornish coast, and as I had climbed upon the rocks and looked down upon the sea, I had wondered to myself whether, if the knowledge were put out before me, I could compose a story of Spanish treasure and pirates. For I am a prey to such giddy ambition. A foul street--if the buildings slant and topple--will set me thinking delightfully of murders. A wharf-end with water lapping underneath and bits of rope about will set me itching for a deep-sea plot. Or if I go on broader range and see in my fancy a broken castle on a hill, I'll clear its moat and sound trumpets on its walls. If there is pepper in my mood, I'll storm its dungeon. Or in a softer moment I'll trim its unsubstantial towers with pageantry and rest upon my elbow until I fall asleep. So being cast upon the rugged Cornish coast whose cliffs are so swept with winter winds that the villages sit for comfort in the hollows, it was to be expected that my thoughts would run toward pirates. There is one rock especially which I had climbed in the rain and fog of early morning. A reckless path goes across its face with a sharp pitch to the ocean. It was so slippery and the wind so tugged and pulled to throw me off, that although I endangered my dignity, I played the quadruped on the narrower parts. But once on top in the open blast of the storm and safe upon the level, I thumped with desire for a plot. In each inlet from the ocean I saw a pirate lugger--such is the pleasing word--with a keg of rum set up. Each cranny led to a cavern with doubloons piled inside. The very tempest in my ears was compounded out of ships at sea and wreck and pillage. I needed but a plot, a thread of action to string my villains on. If this were once contrived, I would spice my text with sailors' oaths and such boasting talk as might lie in my invention. Could I but come upon a plot, I might yet proclaim myself an author. With this guilty secret in me I blushed as I asked the question. It seemed sure that the shopkeeper must guess my purpose. I felt myself suspected as though I were a rascal buying pistols to commit a murder. Indeed, I seem to remember having read that even hardened criminals have become confused before a shopkeeper and betrayed themselves. Of course, Dick Turpin and Jerry Abershaw could call for pistols in the same easy tone they ordered ale, but it would take a practiced villainy. But I in my innocence wanted nothing but the meager outline of a pirate's life, which I might fatten to my uses. But on a less occasion, when there is no plot thumping in me, I still feel a kind of embarrassment when I ask for a book out of the general demand. I feel so like an odd stick. This embarrassment applies not to the request for other commodities. I will order a collar that is quite outside the fashion, in a high-pitched voice so that the whole shop can hear. I could bargain for a purple waistcoat--did my taste run so--and though the sidewalk listened, it would not draw a blush. I have traded even for women's garments--though this did strain me--without an outward twitch. Finally, to top my valor, I have bought sheet music of the lighter kind and have pronounced the softest titles so that all could hear. But if I desire the poems of Lovelace or the plays of Marlowe, I sidle close up to the shopkeeper to get his very ear. If the book is visible, I point my thumb at it without a word. It was but the other day--in order to fill a gap in a paper I was writing--I desired to know the name of an author who is obscure although his work has been translated into nearly all languages. I wanted to know a little about the life of the man who wrote _Mary Had a Little Lamb_, which, I am told, is known by children over pretty much all the western world. It needed only a trip to the Public Library. Any attendant would direct me to the proper shelf. Yet once in the building, my courage oozed. My question, though serious, seemed too ridiculous to be asked. I would sizzle as I met the attendant's eye. Of a consequence, I fumbled on my own devices, possibly to the increase of my general knowledge, but without gaining what I sought. They had no book in the Bath shop on piracy in Cornwall. I was offered instead a work in two volumes on the notorious highwaymen of history, and for a moment my plot swerved in that direction. But I put it by. To pay the fellow for his pains--for he had dug in barrels to his shoulders and had a smudge across his nose--I bought a copy of Thomson's \\\"Castle of Indolence,\\\" and in my more energetic moods I read it. And so I came away. On leaving the shop, lest I should be nipped in a neglect, I visited the Roman baths. Then I took the waters in the Assembly Room. It was Sam Weller, you may recall, who remarked, when he was entertained by the select footmen, that the waters tasted like warm flat-irons. Finally, I viewed the Crescent around which the shirted Winkle ran with the valorous Dowler breathing on his neck. With such distractions, as you may well imagine, Cornish pirates became as naught. Such mental vibration as I had was now gone toward a tale of fashion in the days when Queen Anne was still alive. Of a consequence, I again sought the bookshop and stifling my timidity, I demanded such volumes as might set me most agreeably to my task. I have in mind also a bookshop of small pretension in a town in Wales. For purely secular delight, maybe, it was too largely composed of Methodist sermons. Hell fire burned upon its shelves with a warmth to singe so poor a worm as I. Yet its signboard popped its welcome when I had walked ten miles of sunny road. Possibly it was the chair rather than the divinity that keeps the place in memory. The owner was absent on an errand, and his daughter, who had been clumping about the kitchen on my arrival, was uninstructed in the price marks. So I read and fanned myself until his return. Perhaps my sluggishness toward first editions--to which I have hinted above--comes in part from the acquaintance with a man who in a linguistic outburst as I met him, pronounced himself to be a numismatist and philatelist. One only of these names would have satisfied a man of less conceit. It is as though the pteranodon should claim also to be the spoon-bill dinosaur. It is against modesty that one man should summon all the letters. No, the numismatist's head is not crammed with the mysteries of life and death, nor is a philatelist one who is possessed with the dimmer secrets of eternity. Rather, this man who was so swelled with titles, eked a living by selling coins and stamps, and he was on his way to Europe to replenish his wares. Inside his waistcoat, just above his liver--if he owned so human an appendage--he carried a magnifying glass. With this, when the business fit was on him, he counted the lines and dots upon a stamp, the perforations on its edge. He catalogued its volutes, its stipples, the frisks and curlings of its pattern. He had numbered the very hairs on the head of George Washington, for in such minutiae did the value of the stamp reside. Did a single hair spring up above the count, it would invalidate the issue. Such values, got by circumstance or accident--resting on a flaw--founded on a speck--cause no ferment of my desires. For the buying of books, it is the cheaper shops where I most often prowl. There is in London a district around Charing Cross Road where almost every shop has books for sale. There is a continuous rack along the sidewalk, each title beckoning for your attention. You recall the class of street-readers of whom Charles Lamb wrote--\\\"poor gentry, who, not having wherewithal to buy or hire a book, filch a little learning at the open stalls.\\\" It was on some such street that these folk practiced their innocent larceny. If one shopkeeper frowned at the diligence with which they read \\\"Clarissa,\\\" they would continue her distressing adventures across the way. By a lingering progress up the street, \\\"Sir Charles Grandison\\\" might be nibbled down--by such as had the stomach--without the outlay of a single penny. As for Gibbon and the bulbous historians, though a whole perusal would outlast the summer and stretch to the colder months, yet with patience they could be got through. However, before the end was come even a hasty reader whose eye was nimble on the page would be blowing on his nails and pulling his tails between him and the November wind. But the habit of reading at the open stalls was not only with the poor. You will remember that Mr. Brownlow was addicted. Really, had not the Artful Dodger stolen his pocket handkerchief as he was thus engaged upon his book, the whole history of Oliver Twist must have been quite different. And Pepys himself, Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., was guilty. \\\"To Paul's Church Yard,\\\" he writes, \\\"and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy not, but borrow to read.\\\" Such parsimony is the curse of authors. To thumb a volume cheaply around a neighborhood is what keeps them in their garrets. It is a less offence to steal peanuts from a stand. Also, it is recorded in the life of Beau Nash that the persons of fashion of his time, to pass a tedious morning \\\"did divert themselves with reading in the booksellers' shops.\\\" We may conceive Mr. Fanciful Fopling in the sleepy blink of those early hours before the pleasures of the day have made a start, inquiring between his yawns what latest novels have come down from London, or whether a new part of \\\"Pamela\\\" is offered yet. If the post be in, he will prop himself against the shelf and--unless he glaze and nod--he will read cheaply for an hour. Or my Lady Betty, having taken the waters in the pump-room and lent her ear to such gossip as is abroad so early, is now handed to her chair and goes round by Gregory's to read a bit. She is flounced to the width of the passage. Indeed, until the fashion shall abate, those more solid authors that are set up in the rear of the shop, must remain during her visits in general neglect. Though she hold herself against the shelf and tilt her hoops, it would not be possible to pass. She is absorbed in a book of the softer sort, and she flips its pages against her lap-dog's nose. But now behold the student coming up the street! He is clad in shining black. He is thin of shank as becomes a scholar. He sags with knowledge. He hungers after wisdom. He comes opposite the bookshop. It is but coquetry that his eyes seek the window of the tobacconist. His heart, you may be sure, looks through the buttons at his back. At last he turns. He pauses on the curb. Now desire has clutched him. He jiggles his trousered shillings. He treads the gutter. He squints upon the rack. He lights upon a treasure. He plucks it forth. He is unresolved whether to buy it or to spend the extra shilling on his dinner. Now all you cooks together, to save your business, rattle your pans to rouse him! If within these ancient buildings there are onions ready peeled--quick!--throw them in the skillet that the whiff may come beneath his nose! Chance trembles and casts its vote--eenie meenie--down goes the shilling--he has bought the book. Tonight he will spread it beneath his candle. Feet may beat a snare of pleasure on the pavement, glad cries may pipe across the darkness, a fiddle may scratch its invitation--all the rumbling notes of midnight traffic will tap in vain their summons upon his window. Any Stick Will Do To Beat A Dog Reader, possibly on one of your country walks you have come upon a man with his back against a hedge, tormented by a fiend in the likeness of a dog. You yourself, of course, are not a coward. You possess that cornerstone of virtue, a love for animals. If at your heels a dog sniffs and growls, you humor his mistake, you flick him off and proceed with unbroken serenity. It is scarcely an interlude to your speculation on the market. Or if you work upon a sonnet and are in the vein, your thoughts, despite the beast, run unbroken to a rhyme. But pity this other whose heart is less stoutly wrapped! He has gone forth on a holiday to take the country air, to thrust himself into the freer wind, to poke with his stick for such signs of Spring as may be hiding in the winter's leaves. Having been grinding in an office he flings himself on the great round world. He has come out to smell the earth. Or maybe he seeks a hilltop for a view of the fields that lie below patched in many colors, as though nature had been sewing at her garments and had mended the cloth from her bag of scraps. On such a journey this fellow is travelling when, at a turn of the road, he hears the sound of barking. As yet there is no dog in sight. He pauses. He listens. How shall one know whether the sound comes up a wrathful gullet or whether the dog bays at him impersonally, as at the distant moon? Or maybe he vents himself upon a stubborn cow. Surely it is not an idle tune he practices. He holds a victim in his mind. There is sour venom on his churlish tooth. Is it best to go roundabout, or forward with such a nice compound of innocence, boldness and modesty as shall satisfy the beast? If one engross oneself on something that lies to the lee of danger, it allays suspicion. Or if one absorb oneself upon the flora--a primrose on the river's brim--it shows him clear and stainless. The stupidest dog should see that so close a student can have no evil in him. Perhaps it would be better to throw away one's stick lest it make a show of violence. Or it may be concealed along the outer leg. Ministers of Grace defend us, what an excitement in the barnyard! Has virtue no reward? Shall innocence perish off the earth? Not one dog, but many, come running out. There has gone a rumor about the barn that there is a stranger to be eaten, and it's likely--if they keep their clamor--there will be a bone for each. Note how the valor oozes from the man of peace! Observe his sidling gait, his skirts pulled close, his hollowed back, his head bent across his shoulder, his startled eye! Watch him mince his steps, lest a lingering heel be nipped! Listen to him try the foremost dog with names, to gull him to a belief that they have met before in happier circumstances! He appeals mutely to the farmhouse that a recall be sounded. The windows are tightly curtained. The heavens are comfortless. You remember the fellow in the play who would have loved war had they not digged villainous saltpetre from the harmless earth. The countryside, too, in my opinion, would be more peaceful of a summer afternoon were it not overrun with dogs. Let me be plain! I myself like dogs--sleepy dogs blinking in the firelight, friendly dogs with wagging tails, young dogs in their first puppyhood with their teeth scarce sprouted, whose jaws have not yet burgeoned into danger, and old dogs, too, who sun themselves and give forth hollow, toothless, reassuring sounds. When a dog assumes the cozy habits of the cat without laying off his nobler nature, he is my friend. A dog of vegetarian aspect pleases me. Let him bear a mild eye as though he were nourished on the softer foods! I would wish every dog to have a full complement of tail. It's the sure barometer of his warm regard. There's no art to find his mind's construction in the face. And I would have him with not too much curiosity. It's a quality that brings him too often to the gate. It makes him prone to sniff when one sits upon a visit. Nor do I like dogs addicted to sudden excitement. Lethargy becomes them better. Let them be without the Gallic graces! In general, I like a dog to whom I have been properly introduced, with an exchange of credentials. While the dog is by, let his master take my hand and address me in softest tones, to cement the understanding! At bench-shows I love the beasts, although I keep to the middle of the aisle. The streets are all the safer when so many of the creatures are kept within. Frankly, I would enjoy the country more, if I knew that all the dogs were away on visits. Of course, the highroad is quite safe. Its frequent traffic is its insurance. Then, too, the barns are at such a distance, it is only a monstrous anger can bring the dog. But if you are in need of direction you select a friendly white house with green shutters. You swing open the gate and crunch across the pebbles to the door. To the nearer eye there is a look of \\\"dog\\\" about the place. Or maybe you are hot and thirsty, and there is a well at the side of the house. Is it better to gird yourself to danger or to put off your thirst until the crossroads where pop is sold? Or a lane leads down to the river. Even at this distance you hear the shallow brawl of water on the stones. A path goes off across a hill, with trees beckoning at the top. There is a wind above and a wider sweep of clouds. Surely, from the crest of the hill the whole county will lie before you. Such tunes as come up from the world below--a school-bell, a rooster crowing, children laughing on the road, a threshing machine on the lower meadows--such tunes are pitched to a marvellous softness. Shall we follow the hot pavement, or shall we dare those lonely stretches? There is a kind of person who is steeped too much in valor. He will cross a field although there is a dog inside the fence. Goodness knows that I would rather keep to the highroad with such humility as shall not rouse the creature. Or he will shout and whistle tunes that stir the dogs for miles. He slashes his stick against the weeds as though in challenge. One might think that he went about on unfeeling stalks instead of legs as children walk on stilts, or that a former accident had clipped him off above the knees and that he was now jointed out of wood to a point beyond the biting limit. Or perhaps the clothes he wears beneath--the inner mesh and very balbriggan of his attire--is of so hard a texture that it turns a tooth. Be these defenses as they may, note with what bravado he mounts the wall! One leg dangles as though it were baited and were angling for a bite. There is a French village near Quebec whose population is chiefly dogs. It lies along the river in a single street, not many miles from the point where Wolfe climbed to the Plains of Abraham. There are a hundred houses flat against the roadway and on the steps of each there sits a dog. As I went through on foot, each of these dogs picked me up, examined me nasally and passed me on, not generously as though I had stood the test, but rather in deep suspicion that I was a queer fellow, not to be penetrated at first, but one who would surely be found out and gobbled before coming to the end of the street. As long as I would eventually furnish forth the common banquet, it mattered not which dog took the first nip. Inasmuch as I would at last be garnished for the general tooth, it would be better to wait until all were gathered around the platter. \\\"Good neighbor dog,\\\" each seemed to say, \\\"you too sniff upon the rogue! If he be honest, my old nose is much at fault.\\\" Meantime I padded lightly through the village, at first calling on the dogs by English names, but later using such wisps as I had of French. \\\"Aucassin, mon pauvre chien. Voici, Tintagiles, alors donc mon cherie. Je suis votre ami,\\\" but with little effect. But the dogs that one meets in the Canadian woods are of the fiercest breed. They border on the wolf. They are called huskies and they are so strong and so fleet of foot that they pull sleds for hours across the frozen lakes at almost the speed of a running horse. It must be confessed that they are handsome and if it happens to be your potato peelings and discarded fish that they eat, they warm into friendliness. Indeed, on these occasions, one can make quite a show of bravery by stroking and dealing lightly with them. But once upon a time in an ignorant moment two other campers and myself followed a lonely railroad track and struck off on a path through the pines in search of a certain trapper on a fur farm. The path went on a broken zigzag avoiding fallen trees and soft hollows, conducting itself on the whole with more patience than firmness. We walked a quarter of a mile, but still we saw no cabin. The line of the railroad had long since disappeared. An eagle wheeled above us and quarrelled at our intrusion. Presently to test our course and learn whether we were coming near the cabin, we gave a shout. Immediately out of the deeper woods there came a clamor that froze us. Such sounds, it seemed, could issue only from bloody and dripping jaws. In a panic, as by a common impulse we turned and ran. Yet we did not run frankly as when the circus lion is loose, but in a shamefaced manner--an attempt at a retreat in good order--something between a walk and a run. At the end of a hundred yards we stopped. No dogs had fallen on us. Danger had not burst its kennel. We hallooed again, to rouse the trapper. At last, after a minute of suspense, came his answering voice, the sweetest sound to be imagined. Whereupon I came down from my high stump which I had climbed for a longer view. I am convinced that I am not alone in my--shall I say diffidence?--toward dogs. Indeed, there is evidence from the oldest times that mankind, in its more honest moments, has confessed to a fear of dogs. In recognition of this general fear, the unmuzzled Cerberus was put at the gate of Hades. It was rightly felt that when the unhappy pilgrims got within, his fifty snapping heads were better than a bolt upon the door. It was better for them to endure the ills they had, than be nipped in the upper passage. He, also, who first spoke the ancient proverb, _Let sleeping dogs lie_, did no more than voice the caution of the street. And he, also, who invented the saying that the world is going to the bow-wows, lodged his deplorable pessimism in fitting words. It was Daniel who sat with the lions. But there are degrees of bravery. On Long Street, within sight of my window--just where the street gets into its most tangled traffic--there has hung for many years the painted signboard of a veterinary surgeon. Its artist was in the first flourish of youth. Old age had not yet chilled him when he mixed his gaudy colors. The surgeon's name is set up in modest letters, but the horse below flames with color. What a flaring nostril! What an eager eye! How arched the neck! Here is a wrath and speed unknown to the quadrupeds of this present Long Street. Such mild-eyed, accumbent, sharp-ribbed horses as now infest the curb--mere whittlings from a larger age--hang their heads at their degeneracy. Indeed, these horses seem to their owners not to be worth the price of a nostrum. If disease settles in them, let them lean against a post until the fit is past! And of a consequence, the doctor's work has fallen off. It has become a rare occasion when it is permitted him to stroke his chin in contemplation of some inner palsy. Therefore to give his wisdom scope, the doctor some time since announced the cellar of the building to be a hospital for dogs. Must I press the analogy? I have seen the doctor with bowl and spoon in hand take leave of the cheerful world. He opens the cellar door. A curdling yelp comes up the stairs. In the abyss below there are twenty dogs at least, all of them sick, all dangerous. Not since Orion led his hunting pack across the heavens has there been so fierce a sound. The door closes. There is a final yelp, such as greets a bone. Doubtless, by this time, they are munching on the doctor. Good sir, had you lived in pre-apostolic days, your name would have been lined with Daniel's in the hymn. I might have spent my earliest treble in your praise. But there are other kinds of dogs. Gentlest of readers, have you ever passed a few days at Tunbridge Wells? It lies on one of the roads that run from London to the Channel and for several hundred years persons have gone there to take the waters against the more fashionable ailments. Its chief fame was in the days when rich folk, to ward off for the season a touch of ancestral gout, travelled down from London in their coaches. We may fancy Lord Thingumdo crossing his sleek legs inside or putting his head to the window on the change of horses. He has outriders and a horn to sound his coming. His Lordship has a liver that must be mended, but also he has a weakness for the gaming table. Or Lady Euphemia, wrapped in silks, languishes mornings in her lodgings with a latest novel, but goes forth at noon upon the Pantilles to shop in the stalls. A box of patches must be bought. A lace flounce has caught her eye. Bless her dear eyes, as she bends upon her purchase she is fair to look upon. The Grand Rout is set for tonight. Who knows but that the Duke will put the tender question and will ask her to name the happy day? But these golden days are past. Tunbridge Wells has sunk from fashion. The gaming tables are gone. A band still plays mornings in the Pantilles--or did so before the war--but cheaper gauds are offered in the shops. Emerald brooches are fallen to paste. In all the season there is scarcely a single demand for a diamond garter. If there were now a Rout, the only dancers would be stiff shadows from the past. The healing waters still trickle from the ground and an old woman serves you for a penny, but the miracle has gone. The old world is cured and dead. Tunbridge Wells is visited now chiefly by old ladies whose husbands--to judge by the black lace caps--have left Lombard Street for heaven. At the hotel where I stopped, which was at the top of the Commons outside the thicker town, I was the only man in the breakfast room. Two widows, each with a tiny dog on a chair beside her, sat at the next table. This was their conversation: \\\"Did you hear her last night?\\\" \\\"Was it Flossie that I heard?\\\" \\\"Yes. The poor dear was awake all night. She got her feet wet yesterday when I let her run upon the grass.\\\" But after breakfast--if the day is sunny and the wind sits in a favoring quarter--one by one the widows go forth in their chairs. These are wicker contrivances that hang between three wheels. Burros pull them, and men walk alongside to hold their bridles. Down comes the widow. Down comes a maid with her wraps. Down comes a maid with Flossie. The wraps are adjusted. The widow is handed in. Her feet are wound around with comforters against a draft. Her salts rest in her lap. Her ample bag of knitting is safe aboard. Flossie is placed beside her. Proot! The donkey starts. All morning the widow sits in the Pantilles and listens to the band and knits. Flossie sits on the flagging at her feet with an intent eye upon the ball of worsted. Twice in a morning--three times if the gods are kind--the ball rolls to the pavement. Flossie has been waiting so long for this to happen. It is the bright moment of her life--the point and peak of happiness. She darts upon it. She paws it exultantly for a moment. Brief is the rainbow and brief the Borealis. The finger of Time is swift. The poppy blooms and fades. The maid captures the ball of worsted and restores it. It lies in the widow's lap. The band plays. The needles click to a long tune. The healing waters trickle from the ground. The old woman whines their merits. Flossie sits motionless, her head cocked and her eye upon the ball. Perhaps the god of puppies will again be good to her. ROADS OF MORNING My grandfather's farm lay somewhere this side of the sunset, so near that its pastures barely missed the splash of color. But from the city it was a two hours' journey by horse and phaeton. My grandfather drove. I sat next, my feet swinging clear of the lunchbox. My brother had the outside, a place denied to me for fear that I might fall across the wheel. When we were all set, my mother made a last dab at my nose--an unheeded smudge having escaped my vigilance. Then my grandfather said, \\\"Get up,\\\"--twice, for the lazy horse chose to regard the first summons as a jest. We start. The great wheels turn. My brother leans across the guard to view the miracle. We crunch the gravel. We are alive for excitement. My brother plays we are a steamboat and toots. I toot in imitation, but higher up as if I were a younger sort of steamboat. We hold our hands on an imaginary wheel and steer. We scorn grocery carts and all such harbor craft. We are on a long cruise. Street lights will guide us sailing home. Of course there were farms to the south of the city and apples may have ripened there to as fine a flavor, and to the east, also, doubtless there were farms. It would be asking too much that the west should have all the haystacks, cherry trees and cheese houses. If your judgment skimmed upon the surface, you would even have found the advantage with the south. It was prettier because more rolling. It was shaggier. The country to the south tipped up to the hills, so sharply in places that it might have made its living by collecting nickels for the slide. Indeed, one might think that a part of the city had come bouncing down the slope, for now it lay resting at the bottom, sprawled somewhat for its ease. Or it might appear--if your belief runs on discarded lines--that the whole flat-bottomed earth had been fouled in its celestial course and now lay aslant upon its beam with its cargo shifted and spilled about. The city streets that led to the south, which in those days ended in lanes, popped out of sight abruptly at the top of the first ridge. And when the earth caught up again with their level, already it was dim and purple and tall trees were no more than a roughened hedge. But what lay beyond that range of hills--what towns and cities--what oceans and forests--how beset with adventure--how fearful after dark--these things you could not see, even if you climbed to some high place and strained yourself on tiptoe. And if you walked from breakfast to lunch--until you gnawed within and were but a hollow drum--there would still be a higher range against the sky. There are misty kingdoms on this whirling earth, but the ways are long and steep. The lake lay to the north with no land beyond, the city to the east. But to the west-- Several miles outside the city as it then was, and still beyond its clutches, the country was cut by a winding river bottom with sharp edges of shale. Down this valley Rocky River came brawling in the spring, over-fed and quarrelsome. Later in the year--its youthful appetite having caught an indigestion--it shrunk and wasted to a shadow. By August you could cross it on the stones. The uproar of its former flood was marked upon the shale and trunks of trees here and there were wedged, but now the river plays drowsy tunes upon the stones. There is scarcely enough movement of water to flick the sunlight. A leaf on its idle current is a lazy craft whose skipper nods. There were hickory trees on the point above. May-apples grew in the deep woods, and blackberries along the fences. And in the season sober horses plowed up and down the fields with nodding heads, affirming their belief in the goodness of the soil and their willingness to help in its fruition. Yet the very core of this valley in days past was a certain depth of water at a turn of the stream. There was a clay bank above it and on it small naked boys stood and daubed themselves. One of them put a band of clay about himself by way of decoration. Another, by a more general smudge, made himself a Hottentot and thereby gave his manners a wider scope and license. But by daubing yourself entire you became an Indian and might vent yourself in hideous yells, for it was amazing how the lungs grew stouter when the clay was laid on thick. Then you tapped your flattened palm rapidly against your mouth and released an intermittent uproar in order that the valley might he warned of the deviltry to come. You circled round and round and beat upon the ground in the likeness of a war dance. But at last, sated with scalps, off you dived into the pool and came up a white man. Finally, you stood on one leg and jounced the water from your ear, or pulled a bloodsucker from your toes before he sapped your life--for this tiny creature of the rocks was credited with the gift of prodigious inflation, and might inhale you, blood, sinews, suspenders and all, if left to his ugly purpose. Farms should not be too precisely located; at least this is true of farms which, like my grandfather's, hang in a mist of memory. I read once of a wonderful spot--quite inferior, doubtless, to my grandfather's farm--which was located by evil directions intentionally to throw a seeker off. Munchausen, you will recall, in the placing of his magic countries, was not above this agreeable villainy. Robinson Crusoe was loose and vague in the placing of his island. It is said that Izaak Walton waved a hand obscurely toward the stream where he had made a catch, but could not be cornered to a nice direction, lest his pool be overrun. In early youth, I myself went, on a mischievous hint, to explore a remote region which I was told lay in the dark behind the kindling pile. But because I moved in a fearful darkness, quite beyond the pale light from the furnace room, I lost the path. It did not lead me to the peaks and the roaring waters. But the farm was reached by more open methods. Dolly and the phaeton were the chief instruments. First--if you were so sunk in ignorance as not to know the road--you inquired of everybody for the chewing gum factory, to be known by its smell of peppermint. Then you sought the high bridge over the railroad tracks. Beyond was Kamm's Corners. Here, at a turn of the road, was a general store whose shelves sampled the produce of this whole fair world and the factories thereof. One might have thought that the proprietor emulated Noah at the flood by bidding two of each created things to find a place inside. Beyond Kamm's Corners you came to the great valley. When almost down the hill you passed a house with broken windows and unkept grass. This house, by report, was haunted, but you could laugh at such tales while the morning sun was up. At the bottom of the hill a bridge crossed the river, with loose planking that rattled as though the man who made nails was dead. Beyond the bridge, at the first rise of ground, the horse stopped--for I assume that you drove a sagacious animal--by way of hint that every one of sound limb get out and walk to the top of the hill. A suspicious horse turned his head now and again and cast his eye upon the buggy to be sure that no one climbed in again. Presently you came to the toll-gate at the top and paid its keeper five cents, or whatever large sum he demanded. Then your grandfather--if by fortunate chance you happened to have one--asked after his wife and children, and had they missed the croup; then told him his corn was looking well. My grandfather--for it is time you knew him--lived with us. Because of a railway accident fifteen years before in which one of his legs was cut off just below the knee, he had retired from public office. Several years of broken health had been followed by years that were for the most part free from suffering. My own first recollection reverts to these better years. I recall a tall man--to my eyes a giant, for he was taller even than my father--who came into the nursery as I was being undressed. There was a wind in the chimney, and the windows rattled. He put his crutches against the wall. Then taking me in his arms, he swung me aloft to his shoulder by a series of somersaults. I cried this first time, but later I came to demand the performance. Once, when I was a little older, I came upon one of his discarded wooden legs as I was playing in the garret of the house. It was my first acquaintance with such a contrivance. It lay behind a pile of trunks and I was, at the time, on my way to the center of the earth, for the cheerful path dove into darkness behind the chimney. You may imagine my surprise. I approached it cautiously. I viewed it from all sides by such dusty light as fell between the trunks. Not without fear I touched it. It was unmistakably a leg--but whose? Was it possible that there was a kind of Bluebeard in the family, who, for his pleasure, lopped off legs? There had been no breath of such a scandal. Yet, if my reading and studies were correct, such things had happened in other families not very different from ours; not in our own town maybe, but in such near-by places as Kandahar and Serendib--places which in my warm regard were but as suburbs to our street, to be gained if you persevered for a hundred lamp-posts. Or could the leg belong to Annie the cook? Her nimbleness with griddle-cakes belied the thought: And once, when the wind had swished her skirts, manifestly she was whole and sound. Then all at once I knew it to be my grandfather's. Grown familiar, I pulled it to the window. I tried it on, but made bad work of walking. To the eye my grandfather had two legs all the way down and, except for his crutches and an occasional squeak, you would not have detected his infirmity. Evidently the maker did no more than imitate nature, although, for myself, I used to wonder at the poverty of his invention. There would be distinction in a leg, which in addition to its usual functions, would also bend forward at the knee, or had a surprising sidewise joint--and there would be profit, too, if one cared to make a show of it. The greatest niggard on the street would pay two pins for such a sight. As my grandfather was the only old gentleman of my acquaintance, a wooden leg seemed the natural and suitable accompaniment of old age. Persons, it appeared, in their riper years, cast off a leg, as trees dropped their leaves. But my grandmother puzzled me. Undeniably she retained both of hers, yet her hair was just as white, and she was almost as old. Evidently this law of nature worked only with men. Ladies, it seemed, were not deciduous. But how the amputation was effected in men--whether by day or night--how the choice fell between the right and left--whether the wooden leg came down the chimney (a proper entrance)--how soon my father would go the way of all masculine flesh and cast his off--these matters I could not solve. The Arabian Nights were silent on the subject. Aladdin's uncle, apparently, had both his legs. He was too brisk in villainy to admit a wooden leg. But then, he was only an uncle. If his history ran out to the end, doubtless he would go with a limp in his riper days. The story of the Bible--although it trafficked in such veterans as Methuselah--gave not a hint. Abraham died full of years. Here would have been a proper test--but the book was silent. My grandfather in those days had much leisure time. He still kept an office at the rear of the house, although he had given up the regular practice of the law. But a few old clients lingered on, chiefly women who carried children in their arms and old men without neckties who came to him for free advice. These he guided patiently in their troubles, and he would sit an hour to listen to a piteous story. In an extremity he gave them money, or took a well-meant but worthless note. Often his callers overran the dinner hour and my mother would have to jingle the dinner bell at the door to rouse them. Occasionally he would be called on for a public speech, and for several days he would be busy at his desk. Frequently he presided at dinners and would tell a story and sing a song, for he had a fine bass voice and was famous for his singing. He read much in those last years in science. When he was not reading Trowbridge to his grandchildren, it was Huxley to himself. But when his eyes grew tired, he would on an occasion--if there was canning in the house--go into the kitchen where my mother and grandmother worked, and help pare the fruit. Seriously, as though he were engaged upon a game, he would cut the skin into thinnest strips, unbroken to the end, and would hold up the coil for us to see. Or if he broke it in the cutting it was a point against him in the contest. His diversion rather than his profit was the care and rental of about twenty small houses, some of which he built to fit his pensioners. My brother and myself often made the rounds with him in the phaeton. At most of the houses he was affectionately greeted as \\\"Jedge\\\" and was held in long conversations across the fence. And to see an Irishman was to see a friend. They all knew him and said, \\\"Good mornin',\\\" as we passed. He and they were good Democrats together. I can see in memory a certain old Irishman in a red flannel shirt, with his foot upon the hub, bending across the wheel and gesticulating in an endless discussion of politics or crops, while my brother and I were impatient to be off. Dolly was of course patient, for she had long since passed her fretful youth. If by any biological chance it had happened that she had been an old lady instead of a horse, she would have been the kind that spent her day in a rocker with her knitting. Any one who gave Dolly an excuse for standing was her friend. There she stood as though she wished the colloquy to last forever. It was seldom that Dolly lost her restraint. She would, indeed, when she came near the stable, somewhat hasten her stride; and when we came on our drives to the turning point and at last headed about for home, Dolly would know it and show her knowledge by a quickening of the ears and the quiver of a faint excitement. Yet Dolly lost her patience when there were flies. Then she threw off all repression and so waved her tail that she regularly got it across the reins. This stirred my grandfather to something not far short of anger. How vigorously would he try to dislodge the reins by pulling and jerking! Dolly only clamped down her tail the harder. Experience showed that the only way was to go slowly and craftily and without heat or temper--a slackening of the reins--a distraction of Dolly's attention--a leaning across the dashboard--a firm grasping of the tail out near the end--a sudden raising thereof. Ah! It was done. We all settled back against the cushions. Or perhaps a friendly fly would come to our assistance and Dolly would have to use her tail in another direction. The whip was seldom used. Generally it stood in its socket. It was ornamental like a flagstaff. It forgot its sterner functions. But Dolly must have known the whip in some former life, for even a gesture toward the socket roused her. If it was rattled she mended her pace for a block. But if on a rare occasion my grandfather took it in his hand, Dolly lay one ear back in our direction, for she knew then he meant business. And what an excitement would arise in the phaeton! We held on tight for fear that she might take it into her mild old head to run away. But Dolly had her moments. One sunny summer afternoon while she grazed peacefully in the orchard, with her reins wound around the whip handle--the appropriate place on these occasions--she was evidently stung by a bee. My brother was at the time regaling himself in a near-by blackberry thicket. He looked up at an unusual sound. Without warning, Dolly had leaped to action and was tearing around the orchard dragging the phaeton behind her. She wrecked the top on a low hanging branch, then hit another tree, severing thereby all connection between herself and the phaeton, and at last galloped down the lane to the farm house, with the broken shafts and harness dangling behind her. Kipling's dun \\\"with the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-tree,\\\" could hardly have shown more spirit. It was as though one brief minute of a glorious youth had come back to her. It was a last spurting of an old flame before it sunk to ash. My grandfather gave his leisure to his grandchildren. He carved for us with his knife, with an especial knack for willow whistles. He showed us the colors that lay upon the world when we looked at it through one of the glass pendants of the parlor chandelier. He sat by us when we played duck-on-the-rock. He helped us with our kites and gave a superintendence to our toys. It is true that he was superficial with tin-tags and did not know the difference in value between a Steam Engine tag--the rarest of them all--and a common Climax, but we forgave him as one forgives a friend who is ignorant of Persian pottery. He employed us as gardeners and put a bounty on weeds. We watered the lawn together, turn by turn. When I was no more than four years old, he taught us to play casino with him--and afterwards bezique. How he cried out if he got a royal sequence! With what excitement he announced a double bezique! Or if one of us seemed about to score and lacked but a single card, how intently he contended for the last few tricks to thwart our declaration! And if we got it despite his lead of aces, how gravely he squinted on the cards against deception, with his glasses forward on his nose! When he took his afternoon nap and lay upon his back on the sofa in the sitting-room, we made paper pin-wheels to see whether his breath would stir them. This trick having come to his notice by a sudden awakening, he sometimes thereafter played to be asleep and snored in such a mighty gust that the wheels spun. He was like a Dutch tempest against a windmill. If a Dime Museum came to town we made an afternoon of it. He took us to all the circuses and gave us our choice of side-shows. We walked up and down before the stretches of painted canvas, balancing in our desire a sword-swallower against an Indian Princess. Most of the fat women and all the dwarfs that I have known came to my acquaintance when in company with my grandfather. As a young man, it was said, he once ran away from home to join a circus as an acrobat, having acquired the trick of leaping upon a running horse. I fancy that his knack of throwing us to his shoulder by a double somersault was a recollection of his early days. You may imagine with what awe we looked on him even though he now went on crutches. He was the epitome of adventure, the very salt of excitement. It was better having him than a pirate in the house. When the circus had gone and life was drab, he was our tutor in the art of turning cart-wheels and making hand-stands against the door. And once, when we were away from him, he walked all morning about the garden and in his loneliness he gathered into piles the pebbles that we had dropped. I was too young to know my grandfather in his active days when he was prominent in public matters. His broader abilities are known to others. But though more than twenty years have passed since his death, I remember his tone of voice, his walk, his way of handling a crutch, all his tricks of speech and conduct as though he had just left the room. And I can think of nothing more beautiful than that a useful man who has faced the world for seventy years and has done his part, should come back in his old age to the nursery and be the playfellow of his grandchildren. But the best holiday was a trip to the farm. This farm--to which in our slow trot we have been so long a time in coming--lay for a mile on the upper land, and its grain fields and pastures looked down into the valley. The buildings, however, were set close to the road and fixed their interest on such occasional wagons as creaked by. A Switzer occupied the farm, who owned, in addition to the more immediate members of his family, a cuckoo clock whose weights hung on long cords which by Saturday night reached almost to the floor. When I have sat at his table, I have neglected cheese and the lesser foods, when the hour came near, in order not to miss the cuckoo's popping out. And in the duller spaces, when the door was shut, I have fancied it sitting in the dark and counting the minutes to itself. The Switzer's specialty was the making of a kind of rubber cheese which one could learn to like in time. Of the processes of its composition, I can remember nothing except that when it was in the great press the whey ran from its sides, but this may be common to all cheeses. I was once given a cup of this whey to drink and I brightened, for until it was in my mouth, I thought it was buttermilk. Beyond was the spring-house with cans of milk set in the cool water and with a trickling sound beneath the boards. From the spring-house there started those mysterious cow-paths that led down into the great gorge that cut the farm. Here were places so deep that only a bit of the sky showed and here the stones were damp. It was a place that seemed to lie nearer to the confusion when the world was made, and rocks lay piled as though a first purpose had been broken off. And to follow a cow-path, regardless of where it led, was, in those days, the essence of hazard; though all the while from the pastures up above there came the flat safe tinkling of the bells. The apple orchard--where Dolly was stung by the bee--was set on a fine breezy place at the brow of the hill with the valley in full sight. The trees themselves were old and decayed, but they were gnarled and crotched for easy climbing. And the apples--in particular a russet--mounted to a delicacy. On the other side of the valley, a half mile off as a bird would fly, were the buildings of a convent, and if you waited you might hear the twilight bell. To this day all distant bells come to my ears with a pleasing softness, as though they had been cast in a quieter world. Stone arrow-heads were found in a near-by field as often as the farmer turned up the soil in plowing. And because of this, a long finger of land that put off to the valley, was called Indian Point. Here, with an arm for pillow, one might lie for a long hour on a sunny morning and watch the shadows of clouds move across the lowland. A rooster crows somewhere far off--surely of all sounds the drowsiest. A horse in a field below lifts up its head and neighs. The leaves practice a sleepy tune. If one has the fortune to keep awake, here he may lie and think the thoughts that are born of sun and wind. And now, although it is not yet noon, hunger rages in us. The pancakes, the syrup, the toast and the other incidents of breakfast have disappeared the way the rabbit vanishes when the magician waves his hand. The horrid Polyphemus did not so crave his food. And as yet there is no comforting sniff from the kitchen. Scrubbing and other secular matters engage the farmer's wife. There is as yet not a faintest gurgle in the kettle. To divert ourselves, we climb three trees and fall out of one. Is twelve o'clock never to come? Have Time and the Hour grown stagnant? We eat apples and throw the cores at the pig to hear him grunt. Is the great round sun stuck? Have the days of Joshua come again? We walk a rail fence. Is it not yet noon? Shrewsbury clock itself--reputed by scholars the slowest of all possible clocks--could not so hold off. I snag myself--but it is nothing that shows when I sit. Ah! At last! My grandfather is calling from the house. We run back and find that the lunch is ready and is laid upon a table with a red oil-cloth cover. We apply ourselves. Silence.... The journey home started about five o'clock. There was one game we always played. Each of us, having wisely squinted at the sky, made a reckoning and guessed where we would be when the sun set. My grandfather might say the high bridge. I named the Sherman House. But my brother, being precise, judged it to a fraction of a telegraph pole. Beyond a certain turn--did we remember?--well, it would be exactly sixteen telegraph poles further on. What an excitement there was when the sun's lower rim was already below the horizon! We stood on our knees and looked through the little window at the back of the phaeton. With what suspicion we regarded my grandfather's driving! Or if Dolly lagged, did it not raise a thought that she, too, was in the plot against us? The sun sets. We cry out the victor. The sky flames with color. Then deadens in the east. The dusk is falling. The roads grow dark. Where run the roads of night? While there is light, you can see the course they keep across the country--the dust of horses' feet--a bridge--a vagrant winding on a hill beyond. All day long they are busy with the feet of men and women and children shouting. Then twilight comes, and the roads lead home to supper and the curling smoke above the roof. But at night where run the roads? It's dark beyond the candle's flare--where run the roads of night. My brother and I have become sleepy. We lop over against my grandfather-- We awake with a start. There is a gayly lighted horse-car jingling beside us. The street lights show us into harbor. We are home at last. The Man Of Grub Street Comes From His Garret I have come to live this winter in New York City and by good fortune I have found rooms on a pleasant park. This park, which is but one block in extent, is so set off from the thoroughfares that it bears chiefly the traffic that is proper to the place itself. Grocery carts jog around and throw out their wares. Laundry wagons are astir. A little fat tailor on an occasion carries in an armful of newly pressed clothing with suspenders hanging. Dogs are taken out to walk but are held in leash, lest a taste of liberty spoil them for an indoor life. The center of the park is laid out with grass and trees and pebbled paths, and about it is a high iron fence. Each house has a key to the enclosure. Such social infection, therefore, as gets inside the gates is of our own breeding. In the sunny hours nurses and children air themselves in this grass plot. Here a gayly painted wooden velocipede is in fashion. At this minute there are several pairs of fat legs a-straddle this contrivance. It is a velocipede as it was first made, without pedals. Beau Brummel--for the velocipede dates back to him--may have walked forth to take the waters at Tunbridge Wells on a vehicle not far different, but built to his greater stature. There is also a trickle of drays and wagons across the park--a mere leakage from the streets, as though the near-by traffic in the pressure had burst its pipes. But only at morning and night when the city collects or discharges its people, are the sidewalks filled. Then for a half hour the nozzle of the city plays a full stream on us. The park seems to be freer and more natural than the streets outside. A man goes by gesticulating as though he practiced for a speech. A woman adjusts her stocking on the coping below the fence with the freedom of a country road. A street sweeper, patched to his office, tunes his slow work to fit the quiet surroundings. Boys skate by or cut swirls upon the pavement in the privilege of a playground. My work--if anything so pleasant and unforced can carry the name--is done at a window that overlooks this park. Were it not for several high buildings in my sight I might fancy that I lived in one of the older squares of London. There is a look of Thackeray about the place as though the Osbornes might be my neighbors. A fat man who waddles off his steps opposite, if he would submit to a change of coat, might be Jos Sedley starting for his club to eat his chutney. If only there were a crest above my bell-pull I might even expect Becky Sharp in for tea. Or occasionally I divert myself with the fancy that I am of a still older day and that I have walked in from Lichfield--I choose the name at hazard--with a tragedy in my pocket, to try my fortune. Were it not for the fashion of dress in the park below and some remnant of reason in myself, I could, in a winking moment, persuade myself that my room is a garret and my pen a quill. On such delusion, before I issued on the street to seek my coffee-house, I would adjust my wig and dust myself of snuff. But for my exercise and recreation--which for a man of Grub Street is necessary in the early hours of afternoon when the morning fires have fallen--I go outside the park. I have a wide choice for my wanderings. I may go into the district to the east and watch the children play against the curb. If they pitch pennies on the walk I am careful to go about, for fear that I distract the throw. Or if the stones are marked for hop-scotch, I squeeze along the wall. It is my intention--from which as yet my diffidence withholds me--to present to the winner of one of these contests a red apple which I shall select at a corner stand. Or an ice wagon pauses in its round, and while the man is gone there is a pleasant thieving of bits of ice. Each dirty cheek is stuffed as though a plague of mumps had fallen on the street. Or there may be a game of baseball--a scampering on the bases, a home-run down the gutter--to engage me for an inning. Or shinny grips the street. But if a street organ comes--not a mournful one-legged box eked out with a monkey, but a big machine with an extra man to pull--the children leave their games. It was but the other day that I saw six of them together dancing on the pavement to the music, with skirts and pigtails flying. There was such gladness in their faces that the musician, although he already had his nickel, gave them an extra tune. It was of such persuasive gayety that the number of dancers at once went up to ten and others wiggled to the rhythm. And for myself, although I am past my sportive days, the sound of a street organ, if any, would inflame me to a fox-trot. Even a surly tune--if the handle be quickened--comes from the box with a brisk seduction. If a dirge once got inside, it would fret until it came out a dancing measure. In this part of town, on the better streets, I sometimes study the fashions as I see them in the shops and I compare them with those of uptown stores. Nor is there the difference one might suppose. The small round muff that sprang up this winter in the smarter shops won by only a week over the cheaper stores. Tan gaiters ran a pretty race. And I am now witness to a dead heat in a certain kind of fluffy rosebud dress. The fabrics are probably different, but no matter how you deny it, they are cut to a common pattern. In a poorer part of the city still nearer to the East River, where smells of garlic and worse issue from cellarways, I came recently on a considerable park. It was supplied with swings and teeters and drew children on its four fronts. Of a consequence the children of many races played together. I caught a Yiddish answer to an Italian question. I fancy that a child here could go forth at breakfast wholly a Hungarian and come home with a smack of Russian or Armenian added. The general games that merged the smaller groups, aided in the fusion. If this park is not already named--a small chance, for it shows the marks of age--it might properly be called _The Park of the Thirty Nations_. Or my inclination may take me to the lower city. Like a poor starveling I wander in the haunts of wealth where the buildings are piled to forty stories, and I spin out the ciphers in my brain in an endeavor to compute the amount that is laid up inside. Also, lest I become discontented with my poverty, I note the strain and worry of the faces that I meet. There is a story of Tolstoi in which a man is whispered by his god that he may possess such land as he can circle in a day. Until that time he had been living on a fertile slope of sun and shadow, with fields ample for his needs. But when the whisper came, at a flash, he pelted off across the hills. He ran all morning, but as the day advanced his sordid ambition broadened and he turned his course into a wider and still wider circle. Here a pleasant valley tempted him and he bent his path to bring it inside his mark. Here a fruitful upland led him off. As the day wore on he ran with a greater fierceness, because he knew he would lose everything if he did not reach his starting place before the sun went down. The sun was coming near the rim of earth when he toiled up the last hill. His feet were cut by stones, his face pinched with agony. He staggered toward the goal and fell across it while as yet there was a glint of light. But his effort burst his heart. Does the analogy hold on these narrow streets? To a few who sit in an inner office, Mammon has made a promise of wealth and domination. These few run breathless to gain a mountain. But what have the gods whispered to the ten thousand who sit in the outer office, that they bend and blink upon their ledgers? Have the gods whispered to them the promise of great wealth? Alas, before them there lies only the dust and heat of a level road, yet they too are broken at the sunset. Less oppressive are the streets where commerce is more apparent. Here, unless you would be smirched, it is necessary to walk fast and hold your coat-tails in. Packing cases are going down slides. Bales are coming up in hoists. Barrels are rolling out of wagons. Crates are being lifted in. Is the exchange never to stop? Is no warehouse satisfied with what it has? English, which until now you judged a soft concordant language, shows here its range and mastery of epithet. And all about, moving and jostling the boxes, are men with hooks. One might think that in a former day Captain Cuttle had settled here to live and that his numerous progeny had kept the place. Often I ride on a bus top like a maharajah on an elephant, up near the tusks, as it were, where the view is unbroken. I plan this trip so that I move counter to the procession that goes uptown in the late afternoon. Is there a scene like it in the world? The boulevards of Paris in times of peace are hardly so gay. Fifth Avenue is blocked with motor cars. Fashion has gone forth to select a feather. A ringlet has gone awry and must be mended. The Pomeranian's health is served by sunlight. The Spitz must have an airing. Fashion has wagged its head upon a Chinese vase--has indeed squinted at it through a lorgnette against a fleck--and now lolls home to dinner. Or style has veered an inch, and it has been a day of fitting. At restaurant windows one may see the feeding of the over-fed. Men sit in club windows and still wear their silk hats as though there was no glass between them and the windy world. Footmen in boots and breeches sit as stiffly as though they were toys grown large and had metal spikes below to hold them to their boxes. They look like the iron firemen that ride on nursery fire-engines. For all these sights the bus top is the best place. And although we sit on a modest roof, the shopkeepers cater to us. For in many of the stores, is there not an upper tier of windows for our use? The commodities of this second story are quite as fine as those below. And the waxen beauties who display the frocks greet us in true democracy with as sweet a simper. My friend G---- while riding recently on a bus top met with an experience for which he still blushes. There was a young woman sitting directly in front of him, and when he came to leave, a sudden lurch threw him against her. When he recovered his footing, which was a business of some difficulty, for the bus pitched upon a broken pavement, what was his chagrin to find that a front button of his coat had hooked in her back hair! Luckily G---- was not seized with a panic. Rather, he labored cautiously--but without result. Nor could she help in the disentanglement. Their embarrassment might have been indefinitely prolonged--indeed, G---- was several blocks already down the street--when he bethought him of his knife and so cut off the button. As he pleasantly expressed it to the young woman, he would give her the choice of the button or the coat entire. Reader, are you inclined toward ferry boats? I cannot include those persons who journey on them night and morning perfunctorily. These persons keep their noses in their papers or sit snugly in the cabin. If the market is up, they can hardly be conscious even that they are crossing a river. Nor do I entirely blame them. If one kept shop on a breezy tip of the Delectable Mountains with all the regions of the world laid out below, he could not be expected to climb up for the hundredth time with a first exhilaration, or to swing his alpenstock as though he were on a rare holiday. If one had business across the Styx too often--although the scenery on its banks is reputed to be unusual--he might in time sit below and take to yawning. Father Charon might have to jog his shoulder to rouse him when the boat came between the further piers. But are you one of those persons who, not being under a daily compulsion, rides upon a ferry boat for the love of the trip? Being in this class myself, I laid my case the other night before the gateman, and asked his advice regarding routes. He at once entered sympathetically into my distemper and gave me a plan whereby with but a single change of piers I might at an expense of fourteen cents cross the river four times at different angles. It was at the end of day and a light fog rested on the water. Nothing was entirely lost, yet a gray mystery wrapped the ships and buildings. If New Jersey still existed it was dim and shadowy as though its real life had gone and but a ghost remained. Ferry boats were lighted in defiance of the murk, and darted here and there at reckless angles. An ocean liner was putting out, and several tugs had rammed their noses against her sides. There is something engaging about a tug. It snorts with eagerness. It kicks and splashes. It bursts itself to lend a hand. And how it butts with its nose! Surely its forward cartilages are of triple strength, else in its zest it would jam its nasal passages. Presently we came opposite lower New York. Although the fog concealed the outlines of the buildings, their lights showed through. This first hour of dark is best, before the day's work is done and while as yet all of the windows are lighted. The Woolworth Tower was suffused in a soft and shadowy light. The other buildings showed like mountains of magic pin-pricks. It was as though all the constellations of heaven on a general bidding had met for conference. The man of Grub Street, having by this time somewhat dispelled the fumes of dullness from his head, descends from his ferry boat and walks to his quiet park. There is a dull roar from the elevated railway on Third Avenue where the last of the day's crowd goes home. The sidewalks are becoming empty. There is a sheen of water on the pavement. In the winter murk there is a look of Thackeray about the place as though the Sedleys or the Osbornes might be his neighbors. If there were a crest above his bell-pull he might even expect Becky Sharp in for tea. Now that Spring is here When the sun set last night it was still winter. The persons who passed northward in the dusk from the city's tumult thrust their hands deep into their pockets and walked to a sharp measure. But a change came in the night. The north wind fell off and a breeze blew up from the south. Such stars as were abroad at dawn left off their shrill winter piping--if it be true that stars really sing in their courses--and pitched their voices to April tunes. One star in particular that hung low in the west until the day was up, knew surely that the Spring had come and sang in concert with the earliest birds. There is a dull belief that these early birds shake off their sleep to get the worm. Rather, they come forth at this hour to cock their ears upon the general heavens for such new tunes as the unfaded stars still sing. If an ear is turned down to the rummage of worms in the earth--for to the superficial, so does the attitude attest--it is only that the other ear may be turned upward to catch the celestial harmonies; for birds know that if there is an untried melody in heaven it will sound first across the clear pastures of the dawn. All the chirping and whistling from the fields and trees are then but the practice of the hour. When the meadowlark sings on a fence-rail she but cons her lesson from the stars. It is on such a bright Spring morning that the housewife, duster in hand, throws open her parlor window and looks upon the street. A pleasant park is below, of the size of a city square, and already it stirs with the day's activity. The housewife beats her cloth upon the sill and as the dust flies off, she hears the cries and noises of the place. In a clear tenor she is admonished that there is an expert hereabouts to grind her knives. A swarthy baritone on a wagon lifts up his voice in praise of radishes and carrots. His eye roves along the windows. The crook of a hungry finger will bring him to a stand. Or a junkman is below upon his business. Yesterday the bells upon his cart would have sounded sour, but this morning they rattle agreeably, as though a brisker cow than common, springtime in her hoofs, were jangling to her pasture. At the sound--if you are of country training--you see yourself, somewhat misty through the years, barefoot in a grassy lane, with stick in hand, urging the gentle beast. There is a subtle persuasion in the junkman's call. In these tones did the magician, bawling for old lamps, beguile Aladdin. If there were this morning in my lodging an unrubbed lamp, I would toss it from the window for such magic as he might extract from it. And if a fair Princess should be missing at the noon and her palace be skipped from sight, it will follow on the rubbing of it. The call of red cherries in the park--as you might guess from its Italian source--is set to an amorous tune. What lady, smocked in morning cambric, would not be wooed by such a voice? The gay fellow tempts her to a purchase. It is but a decent caution--now that Spring is here--that the rascal does not call his wares by moonlight. As for early peas this morning, it is Pan himself who peddles them--disguised and smirched lest he be caught in the deception--Pan who stamps his foot and shakes the thicket--whose habit is to sing with reedy voice of the green willows that dip in sunny waters. Although he now clatters his tins and baskets and cries out like a merchant, his thoughts run to the black earth and the shady hollows and the sound of little streams. I have wondered as I have observed the housewives lingering at their windows--for my window also looks upon the park--I have wondered that these melodious street cries are not used generally for calling the wares of wider sale. If a radish can be so proclaimed, there might be a lilt devised in praise of other pleasing merceries--a tripping pizzicato for laces and frippery--a brave trumpeting for some newest cereal. And should not the latest book--if it be a tale of love, for these I am told are best offered to the public in the Spring (sad tales are best for winter)--should not a tale of love be heralded through the city by the singing of a ballad, with a melting tenor in the part? In old days a gaudy rogue cried out upon the broader streets that jugglers had stretched their rope in the market-place, but when the bears came to town, the news was piped even to the narrowest lanes that house-folk might bring their pennies. With my thoughts set on the Spring I chanced to walk recently where the theatres are thickest. It was on a Saturday afternoon and the walk was crowded with amusement seekers. Presently in the press I observed a queer old fellow carrying on his back a monstrous pack of umbrellas. He rang a bell monotonously and professed himself a mender of umbrellas. He can hardly have expected to find a customer in the crowd. Even a blinking eye--and these street merchants are shrewd in these matters--must have told him that in all this hurrying mass of people, the thoughts of no one ran toward umbrellas. Rather, I think that he was taking an hour from the routine of the day. He had trod the profitable side streets until truantry had taken him. But he still made a pretext of working at his job and called his wares to ease his conscience from idleness. Once when an unusually bright beam of sunlight fell from between the clouds, he tilted up his hat to get the warmth and I thought him guilty of a skip and syncopation in the ringing of his bell, as if he too twitched pleasantly with the Spring and his old sap was stirred. I like these persons who ply their trades upon the sidewalk. My hatter--the fellow who cleans my straw hat each Spring--is a partner of a bootblack. Over his head as he putters with his soap and brushes, there hangs a rusty sign proclaiming that he is famous for his cleaning all round the world. He is so modest in his looks that I have wondered whether he really can read the sign. Or perhaps like a true merchant, he is not squeamish at the praise. As I have not previously been aware that any of his profession ever came to general fame except the Mad Hatter of Wonderland, I have squinted sharply at him to see if by chance it might be he, but there are no marks even of a distant kinship. He does, however, bring my hat to a marvellous whiteness and it may be true that he has really tended heads that are now gone beyond Constantinople. Bootblacks have a sense of rhythm unparalleled. Of this the long rag is their instrument. They draw it once or twice across the shoe to set the key and then they go into a swift and pattering melody. If there is an unusual genius in the bootblack--some remnant of ancient Greece--he plays such a lively tune that one's shoulders jig to it. If there were a dryad or other such nimble creature on the street, she would come leaping as though Orpheus strummed a tune, but the dance is too fast for our languid northern feet. Nowhere are apples redder than on a cart. Our hearts go out to Adam in the hour of his temptation. I know one lady of otherwise careful appetite who even leans toward dates if she may buy them from a cart. \\\"Those dear dirty dates,\\\" she calls them, but I cannot share her liking for them. Although the cart is a beguiling market, dates so bought are too dusty to be eaten. They rank with the apple-john. The apple-john is that mysterious leathery fruit, sold more often from a stand than from a cart, which leans at the rear of the shelf against the peppermint jars. For myself, although I do not eat apple-johns, I like to look at them. They are so shrivelled and so flat, as though a banana had caught a consumption. Or rather, in the older world was there not a custom at a death of sending fruits to support the lonesome journey? If so, the apple-john came untasted to the end. Indeed, there is a look of old Egypt about the fruit. Whether my fondness for gazing at apple-johns springs from a distant occasion when as a child I once bought and ate one, or whether it arises from the fact that Falstaff called Prince Hal a dried apple-john, is an unsolved question, but I like to linger before a particularly shrivelled one and wonder what its youth was like. Perhaps like many of its betters, it remained unheralded and unknown all through its fresher years and not until the coming of its wrinkled age was it at last put up to the common view. The apple-john sets up kinship with an author. The day of all fools is wisely put in April. The jest of the day resides in the success with which credulity is imposed upon, and April is the month of easiest credulity. Let bragging travellers come in April and hold us with tales of the Anthropopagi! If their heads are said to grow beneath their shoulders, still we will turn a credent ear. Indeed, it is all but sure that Baron Munchausen came back from his travels in the Spring. When else could he have got an ear? What man can look upon the wonders of the returning year--the first blue skies, the soft rains, the tender sproutings of green stalks without feeling that there is nothing beyond belief? If such miracles can happen before his eyes, shall not the extreme range even of travel or metaphysics be allowed? What man who has smelled the first fragrance of the earth, has heard the birds on their northern flight and has seen an April brook upon its course, will withhold his credence even though the jest be plain? I beg, therefore, that when you walk upon the street on the next day of April fool, that you yield to the occasion. If an urchin points his finger at your hat, humor him by removing it! Look sharply at it for a supposed defect! His glad shout will be your reward. Or if you are begged piteously to lift a stand-pipe wrapped to the likeness of a bundle, even though you sniff the imposture, seize upon it with a will! It is thus, beneath these April skies, that you play your part in the pageantry that marks the day. The Friendly Genii Do you not confess yourself to be several years past that time of greenest youth when burnt cork holds its greatest charm? Although not fallen to a crippled state, are you not now too advanced to smudge your upper lip and stalk agreeably as a villain? Surely you can no longer frisk lightly in a comedy. If you should wheeze and limp in an old man's part, with back humped in mimicry, would you not fear that it bordered on the truth? But doubtless there was a time when you ranged upon these heights--when Kazrac the magician was not too heavy for your art. In those soaring days, let us hope that you played the villain with a swagger, or being cast in a softer role, that you won a pink and fluffy princess before the play was done. Your earliest practice, it may be, was in rigging the parlor hangings as a curtain with brown string from the pantry and safety pins. Although you had no show to offer, you said \\\"ding\\\" three times--as is the ancient custom of the stage when the actors are ready--and drew them wide apart. The cat was the audience, who dozed with an ear twitching toward your activity. A complaint that springs up in youth and is known as \\\"snuffles\\\" had kept you out of school. It had gripped you hard at breakfast, when you were sunk in fear of your lessons, but had abated at nine o'clock. Whether the cure came with a proper healing of the nasal glands or followed merely on the ringing of the school bell, must be left to a cool judgment. Your theatre filled the morning. When Annie came on her quest for dust, you tooted once upon your nose, just to show that a remnant of your infirmity persisted, then put your golden convalescence on the making of your curtain. But in the early hours of afternoon when the children are once more upon the street, you regret your illness. Here they come trooping by threes and fours, carrying their books tied up in straps. One would think that they were in fear lest some impish fact might get outside the covers to spoil the afternoon. Until the morrow let two and two think themselves five at least! And let Ohio be bounded as it will! Some few children skip ropes, or step carefully across the cracks of the sidewalk for fear they spoil their suppers. Ah!--a bat goes by--a glove--a ball! And now from a vacant lot there comes the clamor of choosing sides. Is no mention to be made of you--you, \\\"molasses fingers\\\"--the star left fielder--the timely batter? What would you not give now for a clean bill of health? You rub your offending nose upon the glass. What matters it with what deep rascality in black mustachios you once strutted upon your boards? What is Hecuba to you? My own first theatre was in the attic, a place of squeaks and shadows to all except the valiant. In it were low, dark corners where the night crawled in and slept. But in the open part where the roof was highest, there was the theatre. Its walls were made of a red cambric of a flowered pattern that still lingers with me, and was bought with a clatter of pennies on the counter, together with nickels that had escaped my extravagance at the soda fountain. A cousin and I were joint proprietors. In the making of it, the hammer and nails were mine by right of sex, while she stitched in womanish fashion on the fabrics. She was leading woman and I was either the hero or the villain as fitted to my mood. My younger cousin--although we scorned her for her youth--was admitted to the slighter parts. She might daub herself with cork, but it must be only when we were done. Nor did we allow her to carry the paper knife--shaped like a dagger--which figured hugely in our plots. If we gave her any word to speak, it was as taffy to keep her silent about some iniquity that we had worked against her. In general, we judged her to be too green and giddy for the heavy parts. At the most, she might take pins at the door--for at such a trifle we displayed our talents--or play upon the comb as orchestra before the rising of the curtain. The usual approach to this theatre was the kitchen door, and those who came to enjoy the drama sniffed at their very entrance the new-baked bread. A pan of cookies was set upon a shelf and a row of apples was ranged along the window sill. Of the ice-box around the corner, not a word, lest hunger lead you off! As for the cook, although her tongue was tart upon a just occasion and although she shooed the children with her apron, secretly she liked to have them crowding through her kitchen. Now if you, reader--for I assume you to be one of the gathering audience--were of the kind careful on scrubbing days to scrape your feet upon the iron outside and to cross the kitchen on the unwashed parts, then it is likely that you stood in the good graces of the cook. Mark your reward! As you journeyed upward, you munched upon a cookie and bit scallops in its edge. Or if a ravenous haste was in you--as commonly comes up in the middle afternoon--you waived this slower method and crammed yourself with a recklessness that bestrewed the purlieus of your mouth. If your ears lay beyond the muss, the stowage was deemed decent and in order. Is there not a story in which children are tracked by an ogre through the perilous wood by the crumbs they dropped? Then let us hope there is no ogre lurking on these back stairs, for the trail is plain. It would be near the top, farthest from the friendly kitchen, that the attack might come, for there the stairs yielded to the darkness of the attic. There it was best to look sharp and to turn the corners wide. A brave whistling kept out the other noises. It was after Aladdin had been in town that the fires burned hottest in us. My grandfather and I went together to the matinee, his great thumb within my fist. We were frequent companions. Together we had sat on benches in the park and poked the gravel into patterns. We went to Dime Museums. Although his eyes had looked longer on the world than mine, we seemed of an equal age. The theatre was empty as we entered. We carried a bag of candy against a sudden appetite--colt's foot, a penny to the stick. Here and there ushers were clapping down the seats, sounds to my fancy not unlike the first corn within a popper. Somewhere aloft there must have been a roof, else the day would have spied in on us, yet it was lost in the gloom. It was as though a thrifty owner had borrowed the dusky fabrics of the night to make his cover. The curtain was indistinct, but we knew it to be the Stratford Church and we dimly saw its spire. Now, on the opening of a door to the upper gallery, there was a scampering to get seats in front, speed being whetted by a long half hour of waiting on the stairs. Ghostly, unbodied heads, like the luminous souls of lost mountaineers--for this was the kind of fiction, got out of the Public Library, that had come last beneath my thumb--ghostly heads looked down upon us across the gallery rail. And now, if you will tip back your head like a paper-hanger--whose Adam's apple would seem to attest a life of sidereal contemplation--you will see in the center of the murk above you a single point of light. It is the spark that will ignite the great gas chandelier. I strain my neck to the point of breaking. My grandfather strains his too, for it is a game between us which shall announce the first spurting of the light. At last! We cry out together. The spark catches the vent next to it. It runs around the circle of glass pendants. The whole blazes up. The mountaineers come to life. They lean forward on their elbows. From the wings comes the tuning of the violins. A flute ripples up and down in a care-free manner as though the villain Kazrac were already dead and virtue had come into its own. The orchestra emerges from below. Their calmness is but a pretense. Having looked on such sights as lie behind the curtain, having trod such ways, they should be bubbling with excitement. Yet observe the bass viol! How sodden is his eye! How sunken is his gaze! With what dull routine he draws his bow, as though he knew naught but sleepy tunes! If there be any genie in the place, as the program says, let him first stir this sad fellow from his melancholy! We consult our programs. The first scene is the magician's cave where he plans his evil schemes. The second is the Chinese city where he pretends to be Aladdin's uncle. And for myself, did a friendly old gentleman offer me lollypops and all-day-suckers--for so did the glittering baubles present themselves across the footlights--like Aladdin I, too, would not have squinted too closely on his claim. Gladly I would have gone off with him on an all-day picnic toward the Chinese mountains. We see a lonely pass in the hills, the cave of jewels (splendid to the eye of childhood) where the slave of the lamp first appears, and finally the throne-room with Aladdin seated safely beside his princess. Who knows how to dip a pen within the twilight? Who shall trace the figures of the mist? The play is done. We come out in silence. Our candy is but a remnant. Darkness has fallen. The pavements are wet and shining, so that the night might see his face, if by chance the old fellow looked our way. All about there are persons hurrying home with dinner-pails, who, by their dull eyes, seem never to have heard what wonders follow on the rubbing of a lamp. But how the fires leaped up--how ambition beat within us--how our attic theatre was wrought to perfection--how the play came off and wracked the neighborhood of its pins--with what grace I myself acted Aladdin--these things must be written by a vain and braggart pen. Mr. Pepys Sits in the Pit When it happens that a man has risen to be a member of Parliament, the Secretary of the British Navy and the President of the Royal Society, when he has become the adviser of the King and is moreover the one really bright spot in that King's reign, it is amazing that considerably more than one hundred years after his death, when the navy that he nurtured dominates the seven seas, that he himself on a sudden should be known, not for his larger accomplishments, but as a kind of tavern crony and pot-companion. When he should be standing with fame secure in a solemn though dusty niche in the Temple of Time, it is amazing that he should be remembered chiefly for certain quarrels with his wife and as a frequenter of plays and summer gardens. Yet this is the fate of Samuel Pepys. Before the return of the Stuarts he held a poor clerkship in the Navy Office and cut his quill obscurely at the common desk. At the Restoration, partly by the boost of influence, but chiefly by his substantial merit, he mounted to several successively higher posts. The Prince of Wales became his friend and patron and when he became Lord High Admiral he took Pepys with him in his advancement. Thus in 1684, Pepys became Secretary of the Navy. When later the Prince of Wales became King James II, Pepys, although his office remained the same, came to quite a pinnacle of administrative power. He was shrewd and capable in the conduct of his position and brought method to the Navy Office. He was a prime factor in the first development of the British Navy. Later victories that were to sweep the seas may be traced in part to him. Nelson rides upon his shoulders. These achievements should have made his fame secure. But on a sudden he gained for posterity a less dignified although a more interesting and enduring renown. In life, Samuel Pepys walked gravely in majestical robe with full-bottomed wig and with ceremonial lace flapping at his wrists. Every step, if his portrait is to be believed, was a bit of pageantry. Such was his fame, that if his sword but clacked a warning on the pavement, it must have brought the apprentices to the windows. Tradesmen laid down their wares to get a look at him. Fat men puffed and strained to gain the advantage of a sill. Fashionable ladies peeped from brocaded curtains and ogled for his regard. Or if he went by chair, the carriers held their noses up as though offended by the common air. When he spoke before the Commons, the galleries were hushed. He gave his days to the signing of stiff parchments--Admiralty Orders or what not. He checked the King himself at the council table. In short, he was not only a great personage, but also he was quite well aware of the fact and held himself accordingly. But now many years have passed, and Time, that has so long been at bowls with reputations, has acquired a moderate skill in knocking them down. Let us see how it fares with Pepys! Some men who have been roguish in their lives have been remembered by their higher accomplishments. A string of sonnets or a novel or two, if it catches the fancy, has wiped out a tap-room record. The winning of a battle has obliterated a meanly spent youth. It is true that for a while an old housewife who once lived on the hero's street will shake a dubious finger on his early pranks. Stolen apples or cigarettes behind the barn cram her recollection. But even a village reputation fades. In time the sonnets and glorious battle have the upper place. But things went the other way with Pepys. Rather, his fate is like that of Zeus, who--if legend is to be trusted--was in his life a person of some importance whose nod stirred society on Olympus, but who is now remembered largely for his flirtations and his braggart conduct. A not unlike evil has fallen on the magnificent Mr. Pepys. This fate came to him because--as the world knows--it happened that for a period of ten years in comparative youth, he wrote an interesting and honest diary. He began this diary in 1659, while he was still a poor clerk living with his wife in a garret, and ended it in 1669, when, although he had emerged from obscurity, his greater honors had not yet been set on him. All the facts of his life during this period are put down, whether good or bad, small or large, generous or mean. He writes of his mornings spent in work at his office, of his consultations with higher officials. There is much running to and fro of business. The Dutch war bulks to a proper length. Parliament sits through a page at a stretch. Pepys goes upon the streets in the days of the plague and writes the horror of it--the houses marked with red crosses and with prayers scratched beneath--the stench and the carrying of dead bodies. He sees the great fire of London from his window on the night it starts; afterwards St. Paul's with its roofs fallen. He is on the fleet that brings Charles home from his long travels, and afterwards when Charles is crowned, he records the processions and the crowds. But also Pepys quarrels with his wife and writes it out on paper. He debauches a servant and makes a note of it. He describes a supper at an ale-house, and how he plays on the flute. He sings \\\"Beauty Retire,\\\" a song of his own making, and tells how his listeners \\\"cried it up.\\\" In consequence of this, Samuel Pepys is now known chiefly for his attentions to the pretty actresses of Drury Lane, for kissing Nell Gwynne in her tiring-room, for his suppers with \\\"the jade\\\" Mrs. Knipp, for his love of a tune upon the fiddle, for coming home from Vauxhall by wherry late at night, \\\"singing merrily\\\" down the river. Or perhaps we recall him best for burying his wine and Parmazan cheese in his garden at the time of the Fire, or for standing to the measure of Mr. Pin the tailor for a \\\"camlett cloak with gold buttons,\\\" or for sitting for his portrait in an Indian gown which he \\\"hired to be drawn in.\\\" Who shall say that this is not the very portrait by which we have fancied him stalking off to Commons? Could the apprentices have known in what a borrowed majesty he walked, would they not have tossed their caps in mirth and pointed their dusky fingers at him? Or we remember that he once lived in a garret, and that his wife, \\\"poor wretch,\\\" was used to make the fire while Samuel lay abed, and that she washed his \\\"foul clothes\\\"--that by degrees he came to be wealthy and rode in his own yellow coach--that his wife went abroad in society \\\"in a flowered tabby gown\\\"--that Pepys forsook his habits of poverty and exchanged his twelve-penny seat in the theatre gallery for a place in the pit--and that on a rare occasion (doubtless when he was alone and there was but one seat to buy) he arose to the extravagance of a four-shilling box. Consequently, despite the weightier parts of the diary, we know Pepys chiefly in his hours of ease. Sittings and consultations are so dry. If only the world would run itself decently and in silence! Even a meeting of the Committee for Tangier--when the Prince of Wales was present and such smaller fry as Chancellors--is dull and is matter for a skipping eye. If a session of Parliament bulks to a fat paragraph and it happens that there is a bit of deviltry just below at the bottom of the page--maybe no more than a clinking of glasses (or perhaps Nell Gwynne's name pops in sight)--bless us how the eye will hurry to turn the leaf on the chance of roguery to come! Who would read through a long discourse on Admiralty business, if it be known before that Pepys is engaged with the pretty Mrs. Knipp for a trip to Bartholomew Fair to view the dancing horse, and that the start is to be made on the turning of the page? Or a piece of scandal about Lady Castlemaine, how her nose fell out of joint when Mrs. Stuart came to court--such things tease one from the sterner business. And for these reasons, we have been inclined to underestimate the importance of Pepys' diary. Francis Jeffrey, who wrote long ago about Pepys, evidently thought that he was an idle and unprofitable fellow and that the diary was too much given to mean and petty things. But in reality the diary is an historical mine. Even when Pepys plays upon the surface, he throws out facts that can be had nowhere else. No one would venture to write of Restoration life without digging through his pages. Pepys wrote in a confused shorthand, maybe against the eye of his wife, from whom he had reason to conceal his offenses. The papers lay undeciphered until 1825, when a partial publication was made. There were additions by subsequent editors until now it appears that the Wheatley text of 1893-1899 is final. But ever since 1825, the diary has been judged to be of high importance in the understanding of the first decade of the Restoration. If some of the weightier parts are somewhat dry, there are places in which a lighter show of personality is coincident with real historical data. Foremost are the pages where Pepys goes to the theatre. More than Charles II was restored in 1660. Among many things of more importance than this worthless King, the theatre was restored. Since the close of Elizabethan times it had been out of business. More than thirty years before, Puritanism had snuffed out its candles and driven its fiddlers to the streets. But Puritanism, in its turn, fell with the return of the Stuarts. Pepys is a chief witness as to what kind of theatre it was that was set up in London about the year 1660. It was far different from the Elizabethan theatre. It came in from the Bankside and the fields to the north of the city and lodged itself on the better streets and squares. It no longer patterned itself on the inn-yard, but was roofed against the rain. The time had been when the theatre was cousin to the bear-pit. They were ranged together on the Bankside and they sweat and smelled like congenial neighbors. But these days are past. Let Bartholomew Fair be as rowdy as it pleases, let acrobats and such loose fellows keep to Southwark, the theatre has risen in the world! It has put on a wig, as it were, it has tied a ribbon to itself and has become fashionable. And although it has taken on a few extra dissolute habits, they are of the genteelest kind and will make it feel at home in the upper circles. But also the theatre introduced movable scenery. There is an attempt toward elaboration of stage effect. \\\"To the King's playhouse--\\\" says Pepys, \\\"a good scene of a town on fire.\\\" Women take parts. An avalanche of new plays descends on it. Even the old plays that have survived are garbled to suit a change of taste. But if you would really know what kind of theatre it was that sprang up with the Stuarts and what the audiences looked like and how they behaved, you must read Pepys. With but a moderate use of fancy, you can set out with him in his yellow coach for the King's house in Drury Lane. Perhaps hunger nips you at the start. If so, you stop, as Pepys pleasantly puts it, for a \\\"barrel of oysters.\\\" Then, having dusted yourself of crumbs, you take the road again. Presently you come to Drury Lane. Other yellow coaches are before you. There is a show of foppery on the curb and an odor of smoking links. A powdered beauty minces to the door. Once past the doorkeeper, you hear the cries of the orange women going up and down the aisles. There is a shuffling of apprentices in the gallery. A dandy who lolls in a box with a silken leg across the rail, scrawls a message to an actress and sends it off by Orange Moll. Presently Castlemaine enters the royal box with the King. There is a craning of necks, for with her the King openly \\\"do discover a great deal of familiarity.\\\" In other boxes are other fine ladies wearing vizards to hold their modesty if the comedy is free. A board breaks in the ceiling of the gallery and dust falls in the men's hair and the ladies' necks, which, writes Pepys, \\\"made good sport.\\\" Or again, \\\"A gentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in the midst of the play, did drop down as dead; being choked, but with much ado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat and brought him to life again.\\\" Or perhaps, \\\"I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit backward upon me by a mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a very pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.\\\" At a change of scenes, Mrs. Knipp spies Pepys and comes to the pit door. He goes with her to the tiring-room. \\\"To the women's shift,\\\" he writes, \\\"where Nell was dressing herself, and was all unready, and is very pretty, prettier than I thought.... But to see how Nell cursed for having so few people in the pit, was pretty.\\\"--\\\"But Lord! their confidence! and how many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how confident they are in their talk!\\\" Or he is whispered a bit of gossip, how Castlemaine is much in love with Hart, an actor of the house. Then Pepys goes back into the pit and lays out a sixpence for an orange. As the play nears its end, footmen crowd forward at the doors. The epilogue is spoken. The fiddles squeak their last. There is a bawling outside for coaches. \\\"Would it fit your humor,\\\" asks Mr. Pepys, when we have been handed to our seats, \\\"would it fit your humor, if we go around to the Rose Tavern for some burnt wine and a breast of mutton off the spit? It's sure that some brave company will fall in, and we can have a tune. We'll not heed the bellman. We'll sit late, for it will be a fine light moonshine morning.\\\" To an Unknown Reader Once in a while I dream that I come upon a person who is reading a book that I have written. In my pleasant dreams these persons do not nod sleepily upon my pages, and sometimes I fall in talk with them. Although they do not know who I am, they praise the book and name me warmly among my betters. In such circumstance my happy nightmare mounts until I ride foremost with the giants. If I could think that this disturbance of my sleep came from my diet and that these agreeable persons arose from a lobster or a pie, nightly at supper I would ply my fork recklessly among the platters. But in a waking state these meetings never come. If an article of mine is ever read at all, it is read in secret like the Bible. Once, indeed, in a friend's house I saw my book upon the table, but I suspect that it had been dusted and laid out for my coming. I request my hostess that next time, for my vanity, she lay the book face down upon a chair, as though the grocer's knock intruded. Or perhaps a huckster's cart broke upon her enjoyment. Let it be thought that a rare bargain--tender asparagus or the first strawberries of the summer--tempted her off my pages! Or maybe there was red rhubarb in the cart and the jolly farmer, as he journeyed up the street, pitched it to a pleasing melody. Dear lady, I forgive you. But let us hope no laundryman led you off! Such discord would have marred my book. I saw once in a public library, as I went along the shelves, a volume of mine which gave evidence to have been really read. The record in front showed that it had been withdrawn one time only. The card was blank below--but once certainly it had been read. I hope that the book went out on a Saturday noon when the spirits rise for the holiday to come, and that a rainy Sunday followed, so that my single reader was kept before his fire. A dull patter on the window--if one sits unbuttoned on the hearth--gives a zest to a languid chapter. The rattle of a storm--if only the room be snug--fixes the attention fast. Therefore, let the rain descend as though the heavens rehearsed for a flood! Let a tempest come out of the west! Let the chimney roar as it were a lion! And if there must be a clearing, let it hold off until the late afternoon, lest it sow too early a distaste for indoors and reading! There is scarcely a bookworm who will not slip his glasses off his nose, if the clouds break at the hour of sunset when the earth and sky are filled with a green and golden light. I took the book off the library shelf and timidly glancing across my shoulder for fear that some one might catch me, I looked along the pages. There was a thumb mark in a margin, and presently appeared a kindly stickiness on the paper as though an orange had squirted on it. Surely there had been a human being hereabouts. It was as certain as when Crusoe found the footprints in the sand. Ah, I thought, this fellow who sits in the firelight has caught an appetite. Perhaps he bit a hole and sucked the fruit, and the skin has burst behind. Or I wave the theory and now conceive that the volume was read at breakfast. If so, it is my comfort that in those dim hours it stood propped against his coffee cup. But the trail ended with the turning of the page. There were, indeed, further on, pencil checks against one of the paragraphs as if here the book had raised a faint excitement, but I could not tell whether they sprang up in derision or in approval. Toward the end there were uncut leaves, as though even my single reader had failed in his persistence. Being swept once beyond a usual caution, I lamented to my friend F---- of the neglect in which readers held me, to which the above experience in a library was a rare exception. F---- offered me such consolation as he could, deplored the general taste and the decadence of the times, and said that as praise was sweet to everyone, he, as far as he himself was able, offered it anonymously to those who merited it. He was standing recently in a picture gallery, when a long-haired man who stood before one of the pictures was pointed out to him as the artist who had painted it. At once F---- saw his opportunity to confer a pleasure, but as there is a touch of humor in him, he first played off a jest. Lounging forward, he dropped his head to one side as artistic folk do when they look at color. He made a knot-hole of his fingers and squinted through. Next he retreated across the room and stood with his legs apart in the very attitude of wisdom. He cast a stern eye upon the picture and gravely tapped his chin. At last when the artist was fretted to an extremity, F---- came forward and so cordially praised the picture that the artist, being now warmed and comforted, presently excused himself in a high excitement and rushed away to start another picture while the pleasant spell was on him. Had I been the artist, I would have run from either F----'s praise or disapproval. As an instance, I saw a friend on a late occasion coming from a bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath his arm. I had been avoiding that particular bookstore for a week because my book lay for sale on a forward table. And now when my friend appeared, a sudden panic seized me and I plunged into the first doorway to escape. I found myself facing a soda fountain. For a moment, in my blur, I could not account for the soda fountain, or know quite how it had come into my life. Presently an interne--for he was jacketted as if he walked a hospital--asked me what I'd have. Still somewhat dazed, in my discomposure, having no answer ready, my startled fancy ran among the signs and labels of the counter until I recalled that a bearded man once, unblushing in my presence, had ordered a banana flip. I got the fellow's ear and named it softly. Whereupon he placed a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice-cream, poured on colored juices as though to mark the fatal wound and offered it to me. I ate a few bites of the sickish mixture until the streets were safe. I do not know to what I can attribute my timidity. Possibly it arises from the fact that until recently my writing met with uniform rejection and failure. For years I wrote secretly in order that few persons might know how miserably I failed. I answered upon a question that I had given up the practice, that I now had no time for it, that I scribbled now and then but always burned it. All that while I gave my rare leisure and my stolen afternoons--the hours that other men give to golf and sleep and sitting together--these hours I gave to writing. On a holiday I was at it early. On Saturday when other folks were abroad, I sat at my desk. It was my grief that I was so poor a borrower of the night that I blinked stupidly on my papers if I sat beyond the usual hour. Writing was my obsession. I need no pity for my failures, for although I tossed my cap upon a rare acceptance, my deeper joy was in the writing. That joy repeated failures could not blunt. There are paragraphs that now lie yellow in my desk with their former meaning faded, that still recall as I think of them the first exaltation when I wrote them--feverishly in a hot emotion. In those days I thought that I had caught the sunlight on my pen, and the wind and the moon and the spinning earth. I thought that the valleys and the mountains arose from the mist obedient to me. If I splashed my pen, in my warm regard it was the roar and fury of the sea. It was really no more than my youth crying out. And, alas, my thoughts and my feelings escaped me when I tried to put them down on paper, although I did not know it then. Perhaps they were too vagrant to be held. And yet these paragraphs that might be mournful records of failure, fill me with no more than a tender recollection for the boy who wrote them. The worn phrases now beg their way with broken steps. Like shrill and piping minstrels they whine and crack a melody that I still remember in its freshness. But perhaps, reader, we are brothers in these regards. Perhaps you, too, have faded papers. Or possibly, even on a recent date, you sighed your soul into an essay or a sonnet, and you now have manuscript which you would like to sell. Do not mistake me! I am not an editor, nor am I an agent for these wares. Rather I speak as a friend who, having many such hidden sorrows, offers you a word of comfort. To a desponding Hamlet I exclaim, \\\"'Tis common, my Lord.\\\" I have so many friends that have had an unproductive fling toward letters, that I think the malady is general. So many books are published and flourish a little while in their bright wrappers, but yours and theirs and mine waste away in a single precious copy. I am convinced that a close inspection of all desks--a federal matter as though Capital were under fire--would betray thousands of abandoned novels. There may be a few stern desks that are so cluttered with price-sheets and stock-lists that they cannot offer harborage to a love tale. Standing desks in particular, such as bookkeepers affect, are not always chinked with these softer plots. And rarely there is a desk so smothered in learning--reeking so of scholarship--as not to admit a lighter nook for the tucking of a sea yarn. Even so, it was whispered to me lately that Professor B----, whose word shakes the continent, holds in a lower drawer no fewer than three unpublished historical novels, each set up with a full quota of smugglers and red bandits. One of these stories deals scandalously with the abduction of an heiress, but this must be held in confidence. The professor is a stoic before his class, but there's blood in the fellow. There is, therefore, little use in your own denial. You will recall that once, when taken to a ruined castle, you brooded on the dungeons until a plot popped into your head. You crammed it with quaint phrasing from the chroniclers. You stuffed it with soldiers' oaths. \\\"What ho! landlord,\\\" you wrote gayly at midnight, \\\"a foaming cup, good sir. God pity the poor sailors that take the sea this night!\\\" And on you pelted with your plot to such conflicts and hair-breadth escapes as lay in your contrivance. These things you have committed. Good sir, we are of a common piece. Let us salute as brothers! And therefore, as to a comrade, I bid you continue in your ways. And that you may not lack matter for your pen, I warmly urge you, when by shrewdest computation you have exhausted the plots of adventure and have worn your villains thin, that you proceed in quieter vein. I urge you to an April mood, for the winds of Spring are up and daffodils nod across the garden. There is black earth in the Spring and green hilltops, and there is also the breath of flowers along the fences and the sound of water for your pen to prattle of. A Plague of All Cowards Having written lately against the dog, several acquaintances have asked me to turn upon the cat, and they have been good enough to furnish me with instances of her faithlessness. Also, a lady with whom I recently sat at dinner, inquired of me on the passing of the fish, whether I had ever properly considered the cow, which she esteemed a most mischievous animal. One of them had mooed at her as she crossed a pasture and she had hastily climbed a fence. I get a good many suggestions first and last. I was once taken to a Turkish bath for no other reason--as I was afterwards told--than that it might supply me with a topic. Odd books have been put in my way. A basket of school readers was once lodged with me, with a request that I direct my attention to the absurd selection of the poems. I have been urged to go against car conductors and customs men. On one occasion I received a paper of tombstone inscriptions, with a note of direction how others might be found in a neighboring churchyard if I were curious. A lady in whose company I camped last summer has asked me to give a chapter to it. We were abroad upon a lake in the full moon--we were lost upon a mountain--twice a canoe upset--there were the usual jests about cooking. These things might have filled a few pages agreeably, yet so far they have given me only a paragraph. But I am not disposed toward any of these subjects, least of all the cat, upon which I look--despite the coldness of her nature--as a harmless and comforting appendage of the hearth-rug. I would no more prey upon her morals than I would the morals of the andirons. I choose, rather, to slip to another angle of the question and say a few words about cowards, among whom I have already confessed that I number myself. In this year of battles, when physical courage sits so high, the reader--if he is swept off in the general opinion--will expect under such a title something caustic. He will think that I am about to loose against all cowards a plague of frogs and locusts as if old Egypt had come again. But cowardice is its own punishment. It needs no frog to nip it. Even the sharp-toothed locust--for in the days that bordered so close upon the mastodon, the locust could hardly have fallen to the tender greenling we know today--even the locust that once spoiled the Egyptians could not now add to the grief of a coward. And yet--really I hesitate. I blush. My attack will be too intimate; for I have confessed that I am not the very button on the cap of bravery. I have indeed stiffened myself to ride a horse, a mightier feat than driving him because of the tallness of the monster and his uneasy movement, as though his legs were not well socketed and might fall out on a change of gaits. I have ridden on a camel in a side-show, but have found my only comfort in his hump. I have stroked the elephant. In a solemn hour of night I have gone downstairs to face a burglar. But I do not run singing to these dangers. While your really brave fellow is climbing a dizzy staircase to the moon--I write in figure--I would shake with fear upon a lower platform. Perhaps you recall Mr. Tipp of the Elia essays. \\\"Tipp,\\\" says his pleasant biographer, \\\"never mounted the box of a stage-coach in his life; or leaned against the rails of a balcony; or walked upon the ridge of a parapet; or looked down a precipice; or let off a gun.\\\" I cannot follow Tipp, it may be, to his extreme tremors--my hair will not rise to so close a likeness of the fretful porcupine--yet in a measure we are in agreement. We are, as it were, cousins, with the mark of our common family strong on both of us. There are persons who, when in your company on a country walk, will steal apples, not with a decent caution from a tree along the fence, but far afield. If there are grapes, they will not wait for a turn of the road, but will pluck them in the open. Or maybe in your wandering you come on a half-built house. You climb in through a window to look about. Here the stairs will go. The ice-box will be set against this wall. But if your companion is one of valor's minions, he will not be satisfied with this safe and agreeable research--this mild speculation on bath-rooms--this innocent placing of a stove. He must go aloft. He has seen a ladder and yearns to climb it. The footing on the second story is bad enough. If you fall between the joists, you will clatter to the basement. It is hard to realize that such an open breezy place will ever be cosy and warm with fires, and that sleepy folk will here lie snugly a-bed on frosty mornings. But still the brazen fellow is not content. A ladder leads horribly to the roof. For myself I will climb until the tip of my nose juts out upon the world--until it sprouts forth to the air from the topmost timbers: But I will go no farther. But if your companion sees a scaffold around a chimney, he must perch on it. For him, a dizzy plank is a pleasant belvedere from which to view the world. The bravery of this kind of person is not confined to these few matters. If you happen to go driving with him, he will--if the horse is of the kind that distends his nostrils--on a sudden toss you the reins and leave you to guard him while he dispatches an errand. If it were a motor car there would be a brake to hold it. If it were a boat, you might throw out an anchor. A butcher's cart would have a metal drag. But here you sit defenseless--tied to the whim of a horse--greased for a runaway. The beast Dobbin turns his head and holds you with his hard eye. There is a convulsive movement along his back, a preface, it may be, to a sudden seizure. A real friend would have loosed the straps that run along the horse's flanks. Then, if any deviltry take him, he might go off alone and have it out. I have in mind a livery stable in Kalamazoo. Myself and another man of equal equestrianism were sent once to bring out a thing called a surrey and a pair of horses. Do you happen to be acquainted with Blat's Horse Food? If your way lies among the smaller towns, you must know its merits. They are proclaimed along the fences and up the telegraph poles. Drinking-troughs speak its virtues. Horses thrive on Blat's Food. They neigh for it. A flashing lithograph is set by way of testament wherever traffic turns or lingers. Do you not recall the picture? A great red horse rears himself on his hind legs. His forward hoofs are extended. He is about to trample someone under foot. His nostrils are wide. He is unduly excited. It cannot be food, it must be drink that stirs him. He is a fearful spectacle. There was such a picture on the wall of the stable. \\\"Have you any horses,\\\" I asked nervously, jerking my thumb toward the wall, \\\"any horses that have been fed on just ordinary food? Some that are a little tired?\\\" For I remembered how Mr. Winkle once engaged horses to take the Pickwickians out to Manor Farm and what mishaps befell them on the way. \\\"'He don't shy, does he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. \\\"'Shy, sir?--He wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vagginload of monkeys with their tails burnt off.'\\\" But how Mr. Pickwick dropped his whip, how Mr. Winkle got off his tall horse to pick it up, how he tried in vain to remount while his horse went round and round, how they were all spilt out upon the bridge and how finally they walked to Manor Farm--these things are known to everybody with an inch of reading. \\\"'How far is it to Dingley Dell?' they asked. \\\"'Better er seven mile.' \\\"'Is it a good road?' \\\"'No, t'ant.'... \\\"The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall quadruped, for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust, following slowly at their heels.\\\" \\\"Have you any horses,\\\" I repeated, \\\"that have not been fed on Blat's Food--horses that are, so to speak, on a diet?\\\" In the farthest stalls, hidden from the sunlight and the invigorating infection of the day, two beasts were found with sunken chests and hollow eyes, who took us safely to our destination on their hands and knees. As you may suspect, I do not enjoy riding. There is, it is true, one saddle horse in North Carolina that fears me. If time still spares him, that horse I could ride with content. But I would rather trust myself on the top of a wobbly step-ladder than up the sides of most horses. I am not quite of a mind, however, with Samuel Richardson who owned a hobby-horse and rode on his hearth-rug in the intervals of writing \\\"Pamela.\\\" It is likely that when he had rescued her from an adventure of more than usual danger--perhaps her villainous master has been concealed in her closet--perhaps he has been hiding beneath her bed--it is likely, having brought her safely off, the author locked her in the buttery against a fresh attack. Then he felt, good man, in need of exercise. So while he waits for tea and muffins, he leaps upon his rocking-horse and prances off. As for the hobby-horse itself, I have not heard whether it was of the usual nursery type, or whether it was built in the likeness of the leather camels of a German steamship. I need hardly say that these confessions of my cowardice are for your ear alone. They must not get abroad to smirch me. If on a country walk I have taken to my heels, you must not twit me with poltroonery. If you charge me with such faint-heartedness while other persons are present, I'll deny it flat. When I sit in the company of ladies at dinner, I dissemble my true nature, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat. If then, you taunt me, for want of a better escape, I shall turn it to a jest. I shall engage the table flippantly: Hear how preposterously the fellow talks!--he jests to satisfy a grudge. In appearance I am whole as the marble, founded as a rock. But really some of us cowards are diverting persons. The lady who directed me against the cow is a most delightful woman with whom I hope I shall again sit at dinner. A witty lady of my acquaintance shivers when a cat walks in the room. A man with whom I pass the time pleasantly and profitably, although he will not admit a fear of ghosts, still will not sleep in an empty house because of possible noises. I would rather spend a Saturday evening in the company of the cowardly Falstaff than of the bold Hotspur. If it were not for sack, villainous sack, and a few spots upon his front, you would go far to find a better companion than the fat old Knight. Bob Acres was not much for valor and he made an ass of himself when he went to fight a duel, yet one could have sat agreeably at mutton with him. But these things are slight. It matters little whether or not one can mount a ladder comfortably. Now that motors have come in, horses stand remotely in our lives. Nor is it of great moment whether or not we fear to be out of fashion--whether we halt in the wearing of a wrong-shaped hat, or glance fearfully around when we choose from a line of forks. Superstitions rest mostly on the surface and are not deadly in themselves. A man can be true of heart even if he will not sit thirteen at table. But there is a kind of fear that is disastrous to them that have it. It is the fear of the material universe in all its manifestations. There are persons, stout both of chest and limb, who fear drafts and wet feet. A man who is an elephant of valor and who has been feeling this long while a gentle contempt for such as myself, will cry out if a soft breeze strikes against his neck. If a foot slips to the gutter and becomes wet, he will dose himself. Achilles did not more carefully nurse his heel. For him the lofty dome of air is packed with malignant germs. The round world is bottled with contagion. A strong man who, in his time, might have slain the Sofi, is as fearful of his health as though the plague were up the street. Calamities beset him. The slightest sniffling in his nose is the trumpet for a deep disorder. Existence is but a moving hazard. Life for him, poor fellow, is but a room with a window on the night and a storm beating on the casement. God knows, it is better to grow giddy on a ladder than to think that this majestic earth is such an universal pestilence. The Asperities of the Early British Reviewers Book reviewers nowadays direct their attention, for the most part, to the worthy books and they habitually neglect those that seem beneath their regard. On a rare occasion they assail an unprofitable book, but even this is often but a bit of practice. They swish a bludgeon to try their hand. They only take their anger, as it were, upon an outing, lest with too close housing it grow pallid and shrink in girth. Or maybe they indulge themselves in humor. Perhaps they think that their pages grow dull and that ridicule will restore the balance. They throw it in like a drunken porter to relieve a solemn scene. I fancy that editors of this baser sort keep on their shelves one or two volumes for their readers' sport and mirth. I read recently a review of an historical romance--a last faltering descendant of the race--whose author in an endeavor to restore the past, had made too free a use of obsolete words. With what playfulness was he held up to scorn! Mary come up, sweet chuck! How his quaint phrasing was turned against him! What a merry fellow it is who writes, how sharp and caustic! There's pepper on his mood. But generally, it is said, book reviews are too flattering. Professor Bliss Perry, being of this opinion, offered some time ago a statement that \\\"Magazine writing about current books is for the most part bland, complaisant, pulpy.... The Pedagogue no longer gets a chance at the gifted young rascal who needs, first and foremost, a premonitory whipping; the youthful genius simply stays away from school and carries his unwhipped talents into the market place.\\\" At a somewhat different angle of the same opinion, Dr. Crothers suggests in an essay that instead of being directed to the best books, we need to be warned from the worst. He proposes to set up a list of the Hundred Worst Books. For is it not better, he asks, to put a lighthouse on a reef than in the channel? The open sea does not need a bell-buoy to sound its depth. On these hints I have read some of the book criticisms of days past to learn whether they too were pulpy--whether our present silken criticism always wore its gloves and perfumed itself, or whether it has fallen to this smiling senility from a sterner youth. Although I am usually a rusty student, yet by diligence I have sought to mend my knowledge that I might lay it out before you. Lately, therefore, if you had come within our Public Library, you would have found me in one of these attempts. Here I went, scrimping the other business of the day in order that I might be at my studies before the rush set in up town. Mine was the alcove farthest from the door, where are the mustier volumes that fit a bookish student. So if your quest was the lighter books--such verse and novels as present fame attests--you did not find me. I was hooped and bowed around the corner. I am no real scholar, but I study on a spurt. For a whole week together I may read old plays until their jigging style infects my own. I have set myself against the lofty histories, although I tire upon their lower slopes and have not yet persisted to their upper and windier ridges. I have, also, a pretty knowledge of the Queen Anne wits and feel that I must have dogged and spied upon them while they were yet alive. But in general, although I am curious in the earlier chapters of learning, I lag in the inner windings. However, for a fortnight I have sat piled about with old reviews, whose leather rots and smells, in order that I might study the fading criticisms of the past. Until rather near the end of the eighteenth century, those who made their living in England by writing were chiefly publishers' hacks, fellows of the Dunciad sucking their quills in garrets and selling their labor for a crust, for the reading public was too small to support them. Or they found a patron and gave him a sugared sonnet for a pittance, or strained themselves to the length of an Ode for a berth in his household. Or frequently they supported a political party and received a place in the Red Tape Office. But even in politics, on account of the smallness of the reading public and the politicians' indifference to its approval, their services were of slight account. Too often a political office was granted from a pocket borough in which a restricted electorate could be bought at a trifling expense. To gain support inside the House of Commons was enough. The greater public outside could be ignored. This attitude changed with the coming of the French Revolution. Here was a new force unrealized before--that of a crowd which, being unrepresented and with a real grievance, could, when it liked, take a club and go after what it wanted. For the first time in many years in England--such were the whiffs of liberty across the Channel--the power of an unrepresented public came to be known. It was not that the English crowd had as yet taken the club in its hands, but there were new thoughts abroad in the world, and there was the possibility to be regarded. To influence this larger public, therefore, men who could write came little by little into a larger demand. And as writers were comparatively scarce, all kinds--whether they wrote poems or prose--were pressed into service. It is significant, too, that it was in the decades subjected to the first influence of the French Revolution that the English daily paper took its start as an agent to influence public opinion. It was therefore rather more than one hundred years ago that writers came to a better prosperity. They came out of their garrets, took rooms on the second floor, polished their brasses and became Persons. I can fancy that a writer after spending a morning in the composition of a political article on the whisper of a Cabinet Minister, wrote a sonnet after lunch, and a book review before dinner. Let us see in what mood they took their advancement! Let us examine their temper--but in book reviewing only, for that alone concerns us! In doing this, we have the advantage of knowing the final estimate of the books they judged. Like the witch, we have looked into the seeds of time and we know \\\"which grain will grow and which will not.\\\" In 1802, when the Edinburgh Review (which was the first of its line to acquire distinction) came into being, the passion of the times found voice in politics. Both Whigs and Tories had been alarmed by the excesses of the French Revolution; both feared that England was drifting the way of France; each had a remedy, but opposed and violently maintained. The Tories put the blame of the Revolution on the compromises of Louis XVI, and accordingly they were hostile to any political change. The Whigs, on the other hand, saw the rottenness of England as a cause that would incite her to revolution also, and they advocated reform while yet there was time. The general fear of a revolution gave the government of England to the Tories, and kept them in power for several decades. And England was ripe for trouble. The government was but nominally representative. No Catholic, Jew, Dissenter or poor man had a vote or could hold a seat in Parliament. Industrially and economically the country was in the condition of France in the year of Arthur Young's journey. The poverty was abject, the relief futile and the hatred of the poor for the rich was inflammatory. George III, slipping into feebleness and insanity, yet jealous of his unconstitutional power, was a vacillating despot, quarrelling with his Commons and his Ministers. Lord Eldon as Chancellor, but with as nearly the control of a Premier as the King would allow, was the staunch upholder of all things that have since been disproved and discarded. Bagehot said of him that \\\"he believed in everything which it is impossible to believe in.\\\" France and Napoleon threatened across the narrow channel. England still growled at the loss of her American colonies. It was as yet the England of the old regime. The great reforms were to come thirty years later--the Catholic Emancipation, the abolishment of slavery in the colonies, the suppression of the pocket boroughs, the gross bribery of elections, the cleaning of the poor laws and the courts of justice. It was in this dark hour of English history that the writers polished their brasses and set up as Persons. And if the leading articles that they wrote of mornings stung and snapped with venom, it is natural that the book reviews on which they spent their afternoons had also some vinegar in them, especially if they concerned books written by those of the opposition. And other writers, even if they had no political connection, borrowed their manners from those who had. It was the animosities of party politics that set the general tone. Billingsgate that had grown along the wharves of the lower river, was found to be of service in Parliament and gave a spice and sparkle even to a book review. Presently a large part of literary England wore the tags of political preference. Writers were often as clearly distinguished as were the ladies in the earlier day, when Addison wrote his paper on party patches. There were seats of Moral Philosophy to be handed out, under-secretaryships, consular appointments. It is not enough to say that Francis Jeffrey was a reviewer, he was as well a Whig and was running a Review that was Whig from the front cover to the back. Leigh Hunt was not merely a poet, for he was also a radical, and therefore in the opinions of Tories, a believer in immorality and indecency. No matter how innocent a title might appear, it was held in suspicion, on the chance that it assailed the Ministry or endangered the purity of England. William Gifford was more than merely the editor of the Quarterly Review, for he was as well a Tory editor whose duty it was to pry into Whiggish roguery. Lockhart and Wilson, who wrote in Blackwood's, were Tories tooth and nail, biting and scratching for party. Nowadays, literature, having found the public to be its most profitable patron, works hard and even abjectly for its favor. Although there are defects in the arrangement, it must be confessed that the divorce of literature from politics contributes to the general peace of the household. The Edinburgh Review was founded in 1802, the Quarterly Review in 1809, Blackwood's Magazine in 1817. These three won distinction among others of less importance, and from them only I quote. In 1802, when Tory rule was strongest and Lord Eldon flourished, there was living in Edinburgh a group of young men who were for the most part briefless barristers. Their case was worse because they were Whigs. Few cases came their way and no offices. These young men were Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner, Henry Brougham, and there was also Sydney Smith who had just come to Edinburgh from an English country parish. The eldest was thirty-one, the youngest twenty-three. Although all of them had brilliant lives before them, not one of them had made as yet more than a step toward his accomplishment. Sydney Smith had been but lately an obscure curate, buried in the middle of Salisbury Plain, away from all contact with the world. Francis Jeffrey had been a hack writer in London, had studied medicine, had sought unsuccessfully a government position in India, had written poor sonnets, and was now lounging with but a scanty occupation in the halls of the law courts. Francis Horner had just come to the Scottish bar straight from his studies. Henry Brougham, who in days to come was to be Lord Chancellor of England and to whose skill in debate the passing of the Great Reform bill of 1832 is partly due, is also just admitted to the practice of the law. The founding of the Review was casual. These men were accustomed to meet of an evening for general discussion and speculation. It happened one night as they sat together--the place was a garret if legend is to be believed--that Sydney Smith lamented that their discussions came to nothing, for they were all Whigs, all converted to the cause; whereas if they could only bring their opinions to the outside public they could stir opinion. From so slight a root the Review sprouted. Sydney Smith was made editor and kept the position until after the appearance of the first number, when Jeffrey succeeded him. The Review became immediately a power, appearing quarterly and striking its blows anonymously against a sluggish government, lashing the Tory writers, and taking its part, which is of greater consequence, in the promulgation of the Whig reforms which were to ripen in thirty years and convert the old into modern England. In the destruction of outworn things, it was, as it were, a magazine of Whig explosives. The Quarterly Review was the next to come and it was Tory. John Murray, the London publisher, had been the English distributor of the Edinburgh Review. In 1809, two considerations moved him to found in London a review to rival the Scotch periodical. First the Tory party was being hard hit by the Edinburgh Review and there was need of defense and retaliation. In the second place, John Murray saw that if his publishing house was to flourish, it must provide this new form of literature that had become so popular. For the very shortness of the essays and articles, in which extensive conditions were summarized for quick digestion, had met with English approval as well as Scotch. People had become accustomed, says Bagehot, of taking \\\"their literature in morsels, as they take sandwiches on a journey.\\\" Murray appealed to George Canning, then in office, for assistance and was introduced to William Gifford as a man capable of the undertaking, who would also meet the favor of the government party. The rise of the Quarterly Review was not brilliant. It did not fill the craving for novelty, inasmuch as the Edinburgh was already in the field. Furthermore, there is not the opportunity in defense for as conspicuous gallantry as in offensive warfare. It was eight years before another enduring review was started. William Blackwood of Edinburgh had grown like Murray from a bookseller to a publisher, and he, too, looked for a means of increasing his prestige. He had launched a review the year previously, in 1816, but it had foundered when it was scarcely off the ways. His second attempt he was determined must be successful. His new editors were John G. Lockhart and John Wilson, and the new policy, although nominally Tory, was first and last the magazine's notoriety. It hawked its wares into public notice by sensational articles and personal vilification. Wilson was thirty-two and Lockhart twenty-three, yet they were as mischievous as boys. In their pages is found the most abominable raving that has ever passed for literary criticism. They did not need any party hatred to fire them. William Blackwood welcomed any abuse that took his magazine out of \\\"the calm of respectable mediocrity.\\\" Anything that stung or startled was welcome to a place in its pages. So Blackwood's was published and Edinburgh city, we may be sure, set up a roar of delight and anger. Never before had one's friends been so assailed. Never before had one's enemies been so grilled. How pleasing for a Tory fireside was the mud bath with which it defiled Coleridge, who was--and you had always known it--\\\"little better than a rogue.\\\" One's Tory dinner was the more toothsome for the hot abuse of the Chaldee Manuscript. What stout Tory, indeed, would doze of an evening on such a sheet! There followed of course cases of libel. The editors even found it safer, after the publication of the first number, to retire for a time to the country until the city cooled. I choose now to turn to the pages of these three reviews and set out before you samples of their criticisms, in order that you may contrast them with our own literary judgments. I warn you in fairness that I have been disposed to choose the worst, yet there are hundreds of other criticisms but little better. Of the three reviews, Blackwood's was the least seriously political in its policy, yet its critical vilifications are the worst. The Edinburgh Review, the most able of the three and the most in earnest in politics, is the least vituperative. With this introduction, let us shake the pepperpot and lay out the strong vinegar of our feast! In the judgment of the Edinburgh Review, Tom Moore, who had just published his \\\"Odes and Epistles\\\" but had not yet begun his Irish melodies, is a man who \\\"with some brilliancy of fancy, and some show of classical erudition ... may boast, if the boast can please him, of being the most licentious of modern versifiers, and the most poetical of those who, in our times, have devoted their talents to the propagation of immorality. We regard his book, indeed, as a public nuisance.... He sits down to ransact the impure places of his memory for inflammatory images and expressions, and commits them laboriously in writing, for the purpose of insinuating pollution into the minds of unknown and unsuspecting readers.\\\" Francis Jeffrey wrote this, and Moore challenged him to fight. The police interfered, and as Jeffrey put it, \\\"the affair ended amicably. We have since breakfasted together very lovingly. He has expressed penitence for what he has written and declared that he will never again apply any little talents he may possess to such purpose: and I have said that I shall be happy to praise him whenever I find that he has abjured these objectionable topics.\\\" It was Sydney Smith who said of Jeffrey he would \\\"damn the solar system--bad light--planets too distant--pestered with comets. Feeble contrivance--could make a better with great ease.\\\" Jeffrey reviewed Wordsworth and found in the \\\"Lyrical Ballads\\\" \\\"vulgarity, affectation and silliness.\\\" He is alarmed, moreover, lest his \\\"childishness, conceit and affectation\\\" spread to other authors. He proposes a poem to be called \\\"Elegiac Stanzas to a Sucking Pig,\\\" and of \\\"Alice Fell\\\" he writes that \\\"if the publishing of such trash as this be not felt as an insult on the public taste, we are afraid it cannot be insulted.\\\" When the \\\"White Doe of Rylstone\\\" was published--no prime favorite, I confess, of my own--Jeffrey wrote that it had the merit of being the very worst poem he ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume. \\\"It seems to us,\\\" he wrote, \\\"to consist of a happy union of all the faults, without any of the beauties, which belong to his school of poetry. It is just such a work, in short, as some wicked enemy of that, school might be supposed to have devised, on purpose to make it ridiculous.\\\" Lord Byron, on the publication of an early volume, is counselled \\\"that he do forthwith abandon poetry ... the mere rhyming of the final syllable, even when accompanied by the presence of a certain number of feet ... is not the whole art of poetry. We would entreat him to believe,\\\" continued the reviewer, \\\"that a certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is necessary to constitute a poem; and that a poem in the present day, to be read, must contain at least one thought....\\\" It was this attack that brought forth Byron's \\\"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\\\" As long as Jeffrey hoped to enlist Southey to write for the Edinburgh Review, he treated him with some favor. But Southey took up with the Quarterly. \\\"The Laureate,\\\" says the Edinburgh presently, \\\"has now been out of song for a long time: But we had comforted ourselves with the supposition that he was only growing fat and lazy.... The strain, however, of this publication, and indeed of some that went before it, makes us apprehensive that a worse thing has befallen him ... that the worthy inditer of epics is falling gently into dotage.\\\" Now for the Quarterly Review, if by chance it can show an equal spleen! There lived in the early days of the nineteenth century a woman by the name of Lady Morgan, who was the author of several novels and books of travel. Although her record in intelligence and morals is good, John Croker, who regularly reviewed her books, accuses her works of licentiousness, profligacy, irreverence, blasphemy, libertinism, disloyalty and atheism. There are twenty-six pages of this in one review only, and any paragraph would be worth the quoting for its ferocity. After this attack it was Macaulay who said he hated Croker like \\\"cold boiled veal.\\\" The Quarterly reviewed Keats' \\\"Endymion,\\\" although the writer naively states at the outset that he has not read the poem. \\\"Not that we have been wanting in our duty,\\\" he writes, \\\"far from it--indeed, we have made efforts almost as superhuman as the story itself appears to be, to get through it; but with the fullest stretch of our perseverance we are forced to confess that we have not been able to struggle beyond the first of the four books....\\\" Finally he questions whether Keats is the author's name, for he doubts \\\"that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a rhapsody.\\\" Leigh Hunt's \\\"Rimini\\\" the Quarterly finds to be an \\\"ungrammatical, unauthorized, chaotic jargon, such as we believe was never before spoken, much less written.... We never,\\\" concludes the reviewer, \\\"in so few lines saw so many clear marks of the vulgar impatience of a low man, conscious and ashamed of his wretched vanity, and labouring, with coarse flippancy, to scramble over the bounds of birth and education, and fidget himself into the stout-heartedness of being familiar with a Lord.\\\" In a later review, Hunt is a propounder of atheism. \\\"Henceforth,\\\" says the reviewer, \\\"... he may slander a few more eminent characters, he may go on to deride venerable and holy institutions, he may stir up more discontent and sedition, but he will have no peace of mind within ... he will live and die unhonoured in his own generation, and, for his own sake it is to be hoped, moulder unknown in those which are to follow.\\\" Hazlitt belongs to a \\\"class of men by whom literature is more than at any period disgraced.\\\" His style is suited for washerwomen, a \\\"class of females with whom ... he and his friend Mr. Hunt particularly delight to associate.\\\" Shelley, writes the Quarterly, \\\"is one of that industrious knot of authors, the tendency of whose works we have in our late Numbers exposed to the caution of our readers ... for with perfect deliberation and the steadiest perseverance he perverts all the gifts of his nature, and does all the injury, both public and private, which his faculties enable him to perpetrate.\\\" His \\\"poetry is in general a mere jumble of words and heterogeneous ideas.\\\" \\\"The Cloud\\\" is \\\"simple nonsense.\\\" \\\"Prometheus Unbound\\\" is a \\\"great storehouse of the obscure and unintelligible.\\\" In the \\\"Sensitive Plant\\\" there is \\\"no meaning.\\\" And for Shelley himself, he is guilty of a great many terrible things, including verbiage, impiety, immorality and absurdity. Of Blackwood's Magazine the special victims were Keats and Hunt and Coleridge. \\\"Mr. Coleridge,\\\" says the reviewer, \\\"... seems to believe that every tongue is wagging in his praise--that every ear is open to imbibe the oracular breathings of his inspiration ... no sound is so sweet to him as that of his own voice ... he seems to consider the mighty universe itself as nothing better than a mirror in which, with a grinning and idiot self-complacency, he may contemplate the physiognomy of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.... Yet insignificant as he assuredly is, he cannot put pen to paper without a feeling that millions of eyes are fixed upon him....\\\" Leigh Hunt, says Blackwood, \\\"is a man of extravagant pretensions ... exquisitely bad taste and extremely vulgar modes of thinking.\\\" His \\\"Rimini\\\" \\\"is so wretchedly written that one feels disgust at its pretense, affectation and gaudiness, ignorance, vulgarity, irreverence, quackery, glittering and rancid obscenities.\\\" Blackwood's wrote of the \\\"calm, settled, imperturbable, drivelling idiocy of Endymion,\\\" and elsewhere of Keats' \\\"prurient and vulgar lines, evidently meant for some young lady east of Temple Bar.... It is a better and a wiser thing,\\\" it commented, \\\"to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop, Mr. John, back to 'plasters, pills and ointment boxes.'\\\" And even when Shelley wrote his \\\"Adonais\\\" on the death of Keats, Blackwood's met it with a contemptible parody: \\\"Weep for my Tom cat! all ye Tabbies weep!\\\" Perhaps I have quoted enough. This is the parentage of our silken and flattering criticism. The pages of these old reviews rest yellow on the shelves. From them there comes a smell of rotting leather, as though the infection spreads. The hour grows late. Like the ghost of the elder Hamlet, I detect the morning to be near. The Pursuit of Fire Reader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--whether they be sermons to hurl across your pews, or sonnets in the Spring--doubtless you have moments when you sit at your desk bare of thoughts. Mother Hubbard's cupboard when she went to seek the bone was not more empty. In such plight you chew your pencil as though it were stuff to feed your brain. Or if you are of delicate taste, you fall upon your fingers. Or in the hope that exercise will stir your wits, you pace up and down the room and press your nose upon the window if perhaps the grocer's boy shall rouse you. Some persons draw pictures on their pads or put pot-hooks on their letters--for talent varies--or they roughen up their hair. I knew one gifted fellow whose shoes presently would cramp him until he kicked them off, when at once the juices of his intellect would flow. Genius, I am told, sometimes locks its door and, if unrestrained, peels its outer wrappings. Or, in your poverty, you run through the pages of a favorite volume, with a notebook for a sly theft to start you off. In what dejection you have fallen! It is best that you put on your hat and take your stupid self abroad. Or maybe you think that your creative fire will blaze, if instead of throwing in your wet raw thoughts, you feed it a few seasoned bits. You open, therefore, the drawer of your desk where you keep your rejected and broken fragments--for your past has not been prosperous--hopeful against experience that you can recast one of these to your present mood. This is mournful business. Certain paragraphs that came from you hot are now patched and shivery. Their finer meaning has run out between the lines as though these spaces were sluices for the proper drainage of the page. You had best put on your hat. You will get no comfort from these stale papers. One evening lately, being in this plight, I spread out before me certain odds and ends. I had dug deeper than usual in the drawer and had brought up a yellow stratum of a considerable age. I was poring upon these papers and was wondering whether I could fit them to a newer measure, when I heard a slight noise behind me. I glanced around and saw that a man had entered the room and was now seated in a chair before the fire. In the common nature of things this should have been startling, for the hour was late--twelve o'clock had struck across the way--and I had thought that I was quite alone. But there was something so friendly and easy in his attitude--he was a young man, little more than a lanky boy--that instead of being frightened, I swung calmly around for a better look. He sat with his legs stretched before him and with his chin resting in his hand, as though in thought. By the light that fell on him from the fire, I saw that he wore a brown checked suit and that he was clean and respectable in appearance. His face was in shadow. \\\"Good evening,\\\" I said, \\\"you startled me.\\\" \\\"I am sorry,\\\" he replied. \\\"I beg your pardon. I was going by and I saw your light. I wished to make your acquaintance. But I saw at once that I was intruding, so I sat here. You were quite absorbed. Would you mind if I mended the fire?\\\" Without waiting for an answer, he took the poker and dealt the logs several blows. It didn't greatly help the flame, but he poked with such enjoyment that I smiled. I have myself rather a liking for stirring a fire. He set another log in place. Then he drew from his pocket a handful of dried orange peel. \\\"I love to see it burn,\\\" he said. \\\"It crackles and spits.\\\" He ranged the peel upon the log where the flame would get it, and then settled himself in the big chair. \\\"Perhaps you smoke?\\\" I asked, pushing toward him a box of cigarettes. He smiled. \\\"I thought that you would know my habits. I don't smoke.\\\" \\\"So you were going by and came up to see me?\\\" I asked. \\\"Yes. I was not sure that I would know you. You are a little older than I thought, a little--stouter, but dear me, how you have lost your hair! But you have quite forgotten me.\\\" \\\"My dear boy,\\\" I said, \\\"you have the advantage of me. Where have I seen you? There is something familiar about you and I am sure that I have seen that brown suit before.\\\" \\\"We have never really known each other,\\\" the boy replied. \\\"We met once, but only for an instant. But I have thought of you since that meeting a great many times. I lay this afternoon on a hilltop and wondered what you would be like. But I hoped that sometimes you would think of me. Perhaps you have forgotten that I used to collect railway maps and time-tables.\\\" \\\"Did you?\\\" I replied. \\\"So did I when I was a little younger than you are. Perhaps if I might see your face, I would know you.\\\" \\\"It's nothing for show,\\\" he replied, and he kept it still in shadow. \\\"Would you mind,\\\" he said at length, \\\"if I ate an apple?\\\" He took one from his pocket and broke it in his hands. \\\"You eat half,\\\" he said. I accepted the part he offered me. \\\"Perhaps you would like a knife and plate,\\\" I said. \\\"I can find them in the pantry.\\\" \\\"Not for me,\\\" he replied. \\\"I prefer to eat mine this way.\\\" He took an enveloping bite. \\\"I myself care nothing for plates,\\\" I said. We ate in silence. Presently: \\\"You have my habit,\\\" I said, \\\"of eating everything, skin, seeds and all.\\\" \\\"Everything but the stem,\\\" he replied. By this time the orange peel was hissing and exploding. \\\"You are an odd boy,\\\" I said. \\\"I used to put orange peel away to dry in order to burn it. We seem to be as like as two peas.\\\" \\\"I wonder,\\\" he said, \\\"if that is so.\\\" He turned in his chair and faced me, although his face was still in shadow. \\\"Doubtless, we are far different in many things. Do you swallow grape seeds?\\\" \\\"Hardly!\\\" I cried. \\\"I spit them out.\\\" \\\"I am glad of that.\\\" He paused. \\\"It was a breezy hilltop where I lay. I thought of you all afternoon. You are famous, of course?\\\" \\\"Dear me, no!\\\" \\\"Oh, I'm so sorry. I had hoped you might be. I had counted on it. It is very disappointing. I was thinking about that as I lay on the hill. But aren't you just on the point of doing something that will make you famous?\\\" \\\"By no means.\\\" \\\"Dear me, I am so sorry. Do you happen to be married?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And would you mind telling me her name?\\\" I obliged him. \\\"I don't remember to have heard of her. I didn't think of that name once as I lay upon the hill. Things don't turn out as one might expect. Now, I would have thought--but it's no matter.\\\" For a moment or so he was lost in thought, and then he spoke again: \\\"You were writing when I came into the room?\\\" \\\"Nothing important.\\\" The boy ran his fingers in his hair and threw out his arms impatiently. \\\"That's what I would like to do. I am in college, and I try for one of the papers. But my stuff comes back. But this summer in the vacation, I am working in an office. I run errands and when there is nothing else to do, I study a big invoice book, so as to get the names of things that are bought. There is a racket of drays and wagons outside the windows, and along in the middle of the afternoon I get tired and thick in my head. But I write Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings.\\\" The boy stopped and fixed his eyes on me. \\\"I don't suppose that you happen to be a poet?\\\" \\\"Not at all,\\\" I replied. \\\"But perhaps you are one. Tell me about it!\\\" The boy took a turn at the fire with the poker, but it was chiefly in embarrassment. Presently he returned to his chair. He stretched his long arms upward above his head. \\\"No, I'm not,\\\" he said. \\\"And yet sometimes I think that I have a kind of poetry in me. Only I can't get it into words. I lay thinking about that, too, on the hillside. There was a wind above my head, and I thought that I could almost put words to the tune. But I have never written a single poem. Yet, goodness me, what thoughts I have! But they aren't real thoughts--what you would regularly call thoughts. Things go racing and tingling in my head, but I can never get them down. They are just feelings.\\\" As he spoke, the boy gazed intently through the chimney bricks out into another world. The fireplace was its portal and he seemed to wait for the fires to cool before entering into its possession. It was several moments before he spoke again. \\\"I don't want you to think me ridiculous, but so few understand. If only I could master the tools! Perhaps my thoughts are old, but they come to me with such freshness and they are so unexpected. Could I only solve the frets and spaces inside me here, I could play what tune I chose. But my feelings are cold and stale before I can get them into thoughts. I have no doubt, however, that they are just as real as those other feelings that in time, after much scratching, get into final form and become poetry. I know of course that a man's reach should exceed his grasp--it's hackneyed enough--but just for once I would like to pull down something when I have been up on tiptoe for a while. \\\"Sometimes I get an impression of pity--a glance up a dark hallway--an old woman with a shawl upon her head--a white face at a window--a blind fiddler in the street--but the impression is gone in a moment. Or a touch of beauty gets me. It may be nothing but a street organ in the spring. Perhaps you like street organs, too?\\\" \\\"I do, indeed!\\\" I cried. \\\"There was one today outside my window and my feet kept wiggling to it.\\\" The boy clapped his hands. \\\"I knew that you would be like that. I hoped for it on the hill. As for me, when I hear one, I'm so glad that I could cry out. In its lilt there is the rhythm of life. It moves me more than a hillside with its earliest flowers. Am I absurd? It is equal to the pipe of birds, to shallow waters and the sound of wind to stir me to thoughts of April. Today as I came downtown, I saw several merry fellows dancing on the curb. There are tunes, too, upon the piano that send me off. I play a little myself. I see you have a piano. Do you still play?\\\" \\\"A little, rather sadly,\\\" I replied. \\\"That's too bad, but perhaps you sing?\\\" \\\"Even worse.\\\" \\\"Dear me, that's too bad. I have rather a voice myself. Well, as I was saying, when I hear those tunes, I curl up with the smoke and blow forth from the chimney. If I walk upon the street when the wind is up, and see a light fleece of smoke coming from a chimney top, I think that down below someone is listening to music that he likes, and that his thoughts ride upon the night, like those white streamers of smoke. And then I think of castles and mountains and high places and the sounds of storm. Or in fancy I see a tower that tapers to the moon with a silver gleam upon it.\\\" The strange boy lay back and laughed. \\\"Musicians think that they are the only ones that can hear the finer sounds. If one of us common fellows cocks his ear, they think that only the coarser thumps get inside. And artists think that they alone know the glory of color. I was thinking of that, this afternoon. And yet I have walked under the blue sky. I have seen twilights that these men of paint would botch on canvas. But both musicians and artists have a vision that is greater than their product. The soul of a man can hardly be recorded in black and white keys. Nor can a little pigment which you rub upon your thumb be the measure of an artist. So I suppose that is the way also with poets. It is not to be expected that they can express themselves fully in words that they have borrowed from the kitchen. When their genius flames up, it is only the lesser sparks that fall upon their writing pads. It consoles me that a man should be greater than his achievement. I who have done so little would otherwise be so forlorn.\\\" \\\"It's odd,\\\" I said, when he had fallen into silence, \\\"that I used to feel exactly as you do. It stirs an old recollection. If I am not mistaken, I once wrote a paper on the subject.\\\" The boy smiled dreamily. \\\"But if small persons like myself,\\\" he began, \\\"can have such frenzies, how must it be with those greater persons who have amazed the world? I have wondered in what kind of exaltation Shakespeare wrote his storm in 'Lear.' There must have been a first conception greater even than his accomplishment. Did he look from his windows at a winter tempest and see miserable old men and women running hard for shelter? Did a flash of lightning bare his soul to the misery, the betrayal and the madness of the world? His supreme moment was not when he flung the completed manuscript aside, or when he heard the actors mouth his lines, but in the flash and throb of creation--in the moment when he knew that he had the power in him to write 'Lear.' What we read is the cold forging, wonderful and enduring, but not to be compared to the producing furnace.\\\" The boy had spoken so fast that he was out of breath. \\\"Hold a bit!\\\" I cried. \\\"What you have said sounds familiar. Where could I have heard it before?\\\" There was something almost like a sneer on the boy's face. \\\"What a memory you have! And perhaps you recall this brown suit, too. It's ugly enough to be remembered. Now please let me finish what came to me this afternoon on the hill! Prometheus,\\\" he continued, \\\"scaled the heavens and brought back fire to mortals. And he, as the story goes, clutched at a lightning bolt and caught but a spark. And even that, glorious. Mankind properly accredits him with a marvellous achievement. It is for this reason that I comfort myself although I have not yet written a single line of verse.\\\" \\\"My dear fellow,\\\" I said, \\\"please tell me where I have read something like what you have spoken?\\\" The boy's answer was irrelevant. \\\"You first tell me what you did with a brown checked suit you once owned.\\\" \\\"I never owned but one brown suit,\\\" I replied, \\\"and that was when I was still in college. I think that I gave it away before it was worn out.\\\" The boy once more clapped his hands. \\\"Oh, I knew it, I knew it. I'll give mine tomorrow to the man who takes our ashes. Now, won't you please play the piano for me?\\\" \\\"Assuredly. Choose your tune!\\\" He fumbled a bit in the rack and passing some rather good music, he held up a torn and yellow sheet. \\\"This is what I want,\\\" he said. I had not played it for many years. After a false start or so--for it was villainously set in four sharps for which I have an aversion--I got through it. On a second trial I did better. The boy made no comment. He had sunk down in his chair until he was quite out of sight. \\\"Well,\\\" I said, \\\"what next?\\\" There was no answer. I arose from the bench and glanced in his direction. \\\"Hello,\\\" I cried, \\\"what has become of you?\\\" The chair was empty. I turned on all the lights. He was nowhere in sight. I shook the hangings. I looked under my desk, for perhaps the lad was hiding from me in jest. It was unlikely that he could have passed me to gain the door, but I listened at the sill for any sound upon the stairs. The hall was silent. I called without response. Somewhat bewildered I came back to the hearth. Only a few minutes before, as it seemed, there had been a brisk fire with a row of orange peel upon the upper log. Now all trace of the peel was gone and the logs had fallen to a white ash. I was standing perplexed, when I observed that a little pile of papers lay on the rug just off the end of my desk as by a careless elbow. At least, I thought, this impolite fellow has forgotten some of his possessions. It will serve him right if it is poetry that he wrote upon the hilltop. I picked up the papers. They were yellow and soiled, and writing was scrawled upon them. At the top was a date--but it was twenty years old. I turned to the last sheet. At least I could learn the boy's name. To my amazement, I saw at the bottom in an old but familiar writing, not the boy's name, but my own. I gazed at the chimney bricks and their substance seemed to part before my eyes. I looked into a world beyond--a fabric of moonlight and hilltop and the hot fret of youth. Perhaps the boy had only been waiting for the fire upon the hearth to cool to enter this other world of his restless ambition and desire. Reader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--let us confine ourselves now to sonnets and such airy matter as rides upon the night--doubtless, you sit sometimes at your desk bare of thoughts. The juices of your intellect are parched and dry. In such plight, I beg you not to fall upon your fingers or to draw pictures on your sheet. But most vehemently, and with such emphasis as I possess, I beg you not to rummage among your rejected and broken fragments in the hope of recasting a withered thought to a present mood. Rather, before you sour and curdle, it is good to put on your hat and take your stupid self abroad. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THERE'S PIPPINS AND CHEESE TO COME *** Updated editions will replace the previous one\\u2014the old editions will be renamed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\\u2122 Project Gutenberg\\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\u2122 and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg\\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\u2122 electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. \",\n          \"\\ufeffThe Project Gutenberg eBook of Cottage Cheese Recipe Book This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Title: Cottage Cheese Recipe Book Creator: Milk Industry Foundation Release date: May 13, 2021 [eBook #65327] Language: English Credits: Stephen Hutcheson and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COTTAGE CHEESE RECIPE BOOK *** _Cottage Cheese Recipe Book_ _Appetizers_ _Salads_ _Salad Dressings_ _Breads_ _Main Dishes_ _Desserts_ _Borden Company_ _Nutritive Value of Cottage Cheese_ Cottage cheese is a concentrated form of milk. One pound of cottage cheese contains most of the protein, calcium, phosphorous, iron, and vitamins found in three quarts of milk. Three ounces of cottage cheese furnishes about 50% of an adult\\u2019s daily requirement for calcium. Cottage cheese is a complete protein (builds, repairs, and maintains body tissue); therefore, it is particularly desirable for growing children and is an ideal food for adults. Cottage cheese is easily digested and readily assimilated. It is an important food for the person desiring to lose weight because of its high nutritive value and low caloric content. One ounce of creamed cottage cheese supplies about 30 calories. In addition to its concentrated food value, cottage cheese is also a very versatile food. It can be served in a variety of tempting ways because it combines nicely with almost any type of food.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\\u2122 Project Gutenberg\\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

The Foundation\\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg\\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\u2122 electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg\\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"n_tokens\",\n

The cheese is recognized for its rounded shape, resembling a Cheddar but with its sharp edges smoothed out. Gouda typically weighs between 8 to 16 pounds, with common weights being 10 or 12 pounds. \n","\n","In terms of production, Gouda is made primarily from cow's milk, although there are varieties made with goat's milk as well. The manufacturing process starts with heating fresh milk to a temperature between 88°F and 90°F, after which coloring matter may be added to achieve its characteristic deep yellow hue. Rennet is then introduced, and the cheese curds are formed. Gouda requires careful treatment during its aging process, which usually lasts from two to three months. If the outer surface of the cheese becomes slimy, it is cleaned with warm water and dried.\n","\n","Gouda cheese is known for its slightly sweet flavor, making it less sharp than some other cheeses. Notably, there are variations such as Kosher Gouda, which is made with kosher rennet and is described as a bit more mellow. In the Netherlands, Gouda is a staple in daily meals and is commonly enjoyed on black bread, often paired with butter.\n","\n","Overall, Gouda cheese is a well-rounded, flavorful cheese that is enjoyed worldwide, whether fresh or aged.\n","\n","Was the information available from the extract?
